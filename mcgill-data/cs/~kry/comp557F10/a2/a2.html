<h1>COMP 557 - Fall 2010 - Assignment 2<br>
Perspective Projection Frustums, Depth of Field, and Anaglyphs</h1>
</div>


<h2 class="section">Due 12:00 Noon Wednesday 13 October</h2>

<h2 class="section">Getting Started</h2>

  <div class="sbody">
<img style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 20px;" src="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F10/a2/frustums2.png" border="0" align="right">

  <p>In this assignment you will use projection frustums to draw 
  a scene with blur due to depth of field, and to draw anaglyphs 
  that allow for 3D viewing with inexpensive colour filter glasses.</p>

  <h3 class="section">Provided Code</h3>

<!--  <p>The <a href="a2.zip">sample code</a>  -->
  <p>Download the sample code from WebCT.  It is a working program that
  will display a small test scene (you can change the scene if you
  like).  You will need to add the jogl, vecmath, and mintools jars to
  your project.  The sample code zip file contains only one class.</p>

  <p>The sample code has several drawing modes which you change by entering
  numbers 1 through 7.  They are as follows:</p>

  <ol>

  <li> The world view (default) where you can use the trackball to see
  the scene, the location of your frustums (as shown top right of this
  assignment).</li>

  <li> The view from the eye that lies on the z axis.</li>

  <li> The blurred depth of field view from the eye that lies on the z
  axis.</li>

  <li> The view from the left eye. </li>

  <li> The view from the right eye. </li>

  <li> An anaglyph showing both left and right eyes in the same
  image.</li>

  <li> The combination of a depth of field blur for each eye show as
  an anaglyph.</li>

  </ol>

  The first mode is the only mode that exists in the sample code.  You
  need to implement the others in the steps and objectives listed
  below.  To help with testing your assignment at the different steps,
  you will be using <em>Parameters</em> for various values, such as
  the eye position, and the near and far planes (and many values).
  You should notice that the provided code already uses the
  <em>DoubleParameter</em> class from the mintools jar.  It creates a
  window with controls for each of the parameters.  When you call the
  getValue method of a given parameter, you get the current value
  which is set in the interface.  You will also find IntParameter
  useful for setting the number of samples in your rendering of blur,
  BooleanParameter will be useful for enabling or disabling drawing of
  viewing frustums.  See the comments in the provided code.</p>

  <p>Note that the current version of the mintools jar has a bug in
  that the interface window initially shows all the sliders in the
  middle position (i.e., a position that does not reflect their
  current value).  You will receive an updated jar to fix this problem.</p>

  <p>You will want to use the following OpenGL calls to
  complete the assignment: </p>

  <ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>
  glFrustum
  </em></span>

  <p>You will need to set up several projection frustums by specifying
  the left right top and bottom positions of the near plane, and the
  position of near and far planes.</P> </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>
  glAccum 
  </em></span>

  <p>For depth of field, you will render the scene multiple times with
  slightly different viewing frustums, and blend the results.  The
  accumulation buffer is a convenient mechanism for donig this.  If
  you're blending </em>N<em> images together, use <em>glAccum(
  GL.GL_LOAD, 1f/N )</em> to load the first image into the
  accumulation buffer, and then <em>gl.glAccum( GL.GL_ACCUM, 1f/N
  )</em> to add the contribution of the other renders.  Remember to
  use glClear before drawing each image, and use </em>gl.glAccum(
  GL.GL_RETURN, 1 )</em> to copy the result back into the frame buffer
  once you're finished all rendering passes.</p></li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>
  glColorMask
  </em></span>

  <p>When drawing an anaglyph, you will want to draw one image for the
  left eye, and a different image for the right eye.  With <em>
  glColorMask</em> you can enable or disable writing to different
  components of the frame buffer.  There are four components: red,
  green, blue, and alpha.  The alpha channel is used for transparency
  and should always be enabled to allow for colour blending.  Thus, to
  draw only the red channel, call <em>gl.glColorMask( true, false,
  false, true )</em> before rendering the scene.  To draw an image
  into the green and blue chanells (cyan), then call
  <em>gl.glColorMask( false, true, true, true )</em>, clear the buffer
  with <em>glClear</em>, and draw the scene again with the projection
  matrix for the other eye.  Different glasses will have different
  filters so you'll have to choose your colour masks according to
  those that you're using (e.g., red/blue, red/cyan, or green/magenta,
  where magenta is blue and red combined, and cyan is blue and green
  combined).</p></li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>
  glGetFloatv
  </em></span>

  <p>You need to draw frustums in this assignment, and since you will
  likely find it easier to use <em>glFrustum</em> to set up the
  projection matrix, you will also want to use <em>glGetFloatv</em>
  (with either <em>GL_MODELVIEW_MATRIX</em> or
  <em>GL_PROJECTION_MATRIX</em>) to get a copy of this matrix in a
  Java array.  You can use the provided <em>copyMatrixToFlat</em> and
  <em>copyFlatToMatrix</em> to convert between this row column OpenGL
  format and a vecmath <em>Matrix4f</em>.  You'll use the inverse of
  your projection matrix, combined with <em>glutWireCube(2)</em> to
  draw the frustum.</p></li>

  </ul>

  </div>
 
<h2 class="section">Steps and Objectives</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

  <p>In each step, you should be able to visually verify that your
  implementation is working correctly.  

<ol>
<li> 

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Draw Screen Rectangle and Eye Point</em></span></p>

<p>Draw a white rectangle in the xy plane centered at the origin using
GL_LINE_LOOP.  The x and y dimension should be equal to the width and
height of the display window in meters.  Getting the screen dimensions
approximately correct is important for correct 3D viewing, so you'll
want to measure the width of your screen with a ruler and set the
variable <em>metersPerPixel</em> appropriately (see the commented
code).
</p>

<p>Draw a white sphere at the position of the eye using
glutSolidSphere.  Note that with lighting disabled, it should just
look like a white circle, i.e., no shading.  The radius should be
0.0125 meters to approximate the size of the human eye.  Call
<em>getValue</em> on the </em>eyeZPosition</em> member variable to find
out where to draw the eye on the z axis.</p>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Draw Frustum (2 marks)</em></span></p>

<p>In this step, you will want to create a projection matrix using
glFrustum that will be needed to project points on the screen.  The
<em>near</em> and <em>far</em> parameters should be used to compute
the near and far plane positions.  Notice that these near and far
plane positions are specified with respect to the origin, so you'll
need to add the eye position to compute the value to pass to
glFrustum.  The motivation for defining these parameters in world
space is that they don't depend on anything.  That is, when in mode 1,
world viewing mode, you can easily change the eye distance while
leaving the near and far planes fixed with respect to the screen
rectangle. </p>

<p>Note that since you must provide left, right, top and bottom of the
near plane, you will need to compute appropriate values to take into
account the position of the near plane with respect to the screen
rectangle (i.e., the screen rectangle should exactly fit inside your
frustum).</p>

<p>Use the technique described in the assignment introduction to draw
a white wire frustum when <em>drawCenterEyeFrustum</em> is true.  For
instance, you might first do a glPushMatrix, load the identity, set up
your frustum, then extract it with getDoublev, and then pop your
changes off the stack; then invert your matrix and put the inverse on
the stack along with any necessary translation to accommodate the eye
position, and draw a wire cube size 2 to show the region that will be
projected to normalized device coordinates.</p>

<p>You should also now implement viewing mode 2 which shows the result
of using this frustum.  The easiest thing to do is overwrite the
opengl projection and modelview matrices to be your projection and
viewing transformation (i.e., the translation to the eye position).<p>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Focal Plane Rectangle (2 marks)</em></span></p>

<p>Draw a grey rectangle to represent the focal plane.  The focal
plane is in the xy plane, and at a displacement in z from the origin
specified by the <em>focalPlaneZPosition</em> parameter.  You need to
compute the left, right, top, and bottom coordinates of the focal
plane so that it exactly fits inside your frustum.  Try moving your
focal plane to different distances.  Note that you should be able to
place it beyond your far plane, or in front of your near plane.</p>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Eye Position Offset (2 marks) </em></span></p>

<p>In this step, you will use the x and y offset parameters
<em>eyeXOffset</em> and <em>eyeYOffset</em> to create a frustum at an
eye position that is displaced from its position on the z axis.  The
idea is to explore the frustums which keep the focal plane rectangle
fixed while using different eye positions.  In the next step, you'll
average together images created from many nearby eye positions while
keeping the focal plane fixed in order to create an image with a depth
of field effect.  The purpose of this step is to make sure that you're
frustum is correct before proceeding.</p>

<p>Adjust your eye and frustum drawing code from previous steps to
account for the displaced eye position.  Compute left, right, top, and
bottom values to pass to glFrustum to create the correct frustum which
always contains the focal plane.  Test your code by moving the focal
plane and the eye offsets, and convincing yourself that it is doing
the right thing.</p>

<li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
<img style="padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F10/a2/focus.png" border="0" align="right">
         <em>Depth of Field Blur</em></span></p>

<p>Implement viewing mode 3 by averaging multiple renders of the scene
with the accumulation buffer.  Use the <em>samples</em> parameter to
get an integer number of samples to use in each axis direction, and
use the <em>apertureSize</em> parameter as the width and height of
the region in which you move the eye position.  So with samples set to
3, you will render and average 9 images.  Note that while using a
square aperture is easiest, you could also sample in a region of a
different shape.</p>

  </li>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Draw Left and Right Eyes</em></span></p>

<p>This step can be done independently of steps 3, 4, and 5.  For this
objective you must create frustums for left and right eyes.  You
should display both eye positions and their frustums in the same way
as in step 2, but only if <em>drawEyeFrustums</em> is true.  The
frustums should be colour coded according to the glasses that you are
using, so if the filter for your left eye is red, then you should draw
the left eye frustum and left eye position in red. </p>

<p>The frustums should both contain the screen rectangle, thus you'll
need to compute correct left, right, bottom, and top values for each.
The <em>eyeDisparity</em> parameter should be used to set the distance
between the eyes (default of 63 mm), so the left eye should be half
this distance in the negative x direction, while the right eye should
be half this distance in the positive x direction (i.e., the center
point between the eyes lies on the z axis).  </p>

<p> Note that if we were able to track the eyes, then we might want to
use the known position of each eye in setting up the frustum.
However, we will just assume that the viewer is sitting exactly in
front of the screen at a distance from the screen specified by
<em>eyeZPosition</em>.

<p>Test that your frustums are correct by adjusting the near plane, and by 
viewing the resulting images with viewing mode 4 and 5.</p>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
<img style="padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F10/a2/anaglyph.png" border="0" align="right">
         <em>Anaglyphs</em></span></p>

<p>Combine the images you render for mode 4 and 5 by using the
appropriate glColorMask calls.  Test your image using colour glasses.
You should be able to make objects appear both behind and in front of
the screen.  Be sure you do not have your left and right eyes
reversed!  The <em>eyeDisparity</em> parameter value should always be
a positive number.

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Anaglyphs with Defocus (optional, 5% bonus)</em></span></p>

<p> Combine your efforts in the previous step to create anaglyphs
where the left and right images have blur due to depth of field.  The
trick is to define your frustums correctly.  The offsets you use to
create the blurred image need to keep the focal plane rectangle fixed,
but this focal plane rectangle is different for each eye as it is
defined by the eye position and the screen rectangle position.</p>

  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
  <em>Readme File (0 marks, yet not optional)</em></span>

       <p> Create a <em>readme.txt</em> or <em>readme.pdf</em> file to
       submit with your assignment.  The readme should include any
       comments you have with respect to the assignment, and describes
       anything you deem to be noteworthy.  Try to be brief!
