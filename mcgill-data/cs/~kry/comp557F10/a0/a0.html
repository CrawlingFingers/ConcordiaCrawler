This is not a real assignment, but instead is intended
as means to help you get set up for doing the assignments and the
beginning of term OpenGL&nbsp;tutorials. The lab machines already
have the necessary software installed, but if you are using your own
machine then you may need to install some software.</p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;"><em>Java
and Eclipse Software</em></span></p>

      <p>If you are
not already using Sun/Oracle Java, or have a very old installation,
then download and install the latest <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java
SE JDK</a> (careful not to select the JRE). &nbsp;Note that
you may already have "other" Java versions&nbsp;installed on your
machine (for instance, Microsoft&nbsp;or GNU Java), but avoid using
these as they will very likely lead to problems. &nbsp;</p>

      <p>I also strongly recommend
using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>
as a development environment. If you need to install it, then I suggest
downloading the
      <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse
IDE for Java Developers</a>. If you have multiple versions of
java installed, you'll also want to make sure that you are using the
appropriate JDK (see Window-&gt;Preferences, Java, Installed JREs)
and have the compiler compliance
level is set to 1.6
(see Window-&gt;Preferences, Java, Compiler). If you are familiar
with Eclipse, you can probably skip the rest of this section.</p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;"><em>Using
Eclipse</em></span></p>

      <p>Eclipse uses a workspace to organize your projects. When
you start
eclipse for the first time, it will make you a workspace in some
default location (probably your home directory), but you can switch
workspaces with the file menu, and open any folder you want for your
workspace. One nice way to organize this would be to create a
workspaceComp557 folder in your home directory, then tell eclipse to
open that workspace.</p>

      <p>
Once your workspace is open, add a new java project, give it a name,
such as A0. The defaults for the project when you click next are
probably fine, e.g., default JRE, separate folders for source and class
files. Once it is created, you will see a src folder for the source
files and bin for the class files (note that you may eventually create
additional folders for data).</p>

      <p>
Lastly a few tips on using eclipse when you're browsing the code. If
you let your mouse hover over an identifier, variable or method, a
window will pop up telling you what it is, and providing you with the
javadoc. If you hold ctrl and click on an identifier, it will take you
to its definition (e.g., the implementation of a method). This is a
great way to explore code rapidly! Note the yellow forward and back
buttons on the tool bar are useful for going back to where you were
after control clicking an identifier.</p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;"><em>Provided
Code</em></span></p>

      <p>Download the <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F10/a0/a0.zip">provided
code</a>
and dump it into a new java project. Note that the code lives in the <i>comp557.a0</i>
package. Please do not
change the package name for any of your assignments. &nbsp;This
example code contains a minimal example framework with which you can
try out the OpenGL API, and may be of use during the
tutorials.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>You'll want to put the provided code (see below) in src
folder of your
new project, and there are lots of ways to do this. Most
importantly,&nbsp;you need the directory structure to match the
package structure! An easy way is to copy the directory provided in the
zip file and paste it into the src directory. Since everything lives in
the package <span style="font-style: italic;">comp557</span>
you need this folder (i.e., you can't just copy and
paste the <span style="font-style: italic;">a0 </span>folder
into src). If you copy files into your project on
the file system side, you'll need to tell Eclipse to refresh its view
of the project (right click on the project and select refresh). This
summarizes the steps for "dumping the source code into a project".
You'll have lots of errors at this point, but they all go away when you
attach the jars as specified in the assignment.</p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;"><em>Libraries</em></span></p>

      <p>The provided code uses <i>JOGL</i> for
OpenGL
bindings.
      <i>JOGL</i> has been around for many years and has
changed over the years to keep up to date with the evolving OpenGL
specification. &nbsp;The latest version involves "profiles" to
allow for applications to be developed for different versions of OpenGL
and different hardware (e.g., OpenGL ES 2.0, as you would use for an
Android or iOS device). &nbsp;We will use the previous version to
avoid profiles, and also because builds of the libraries are available
for a large variety of platforms&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://jogl.dev.java.net/">jogl.dev.java.net</a>.
Go to the release build page <a href="http://download.java.net/media/jogl/builds/archive/jsr-231-1.1.1a/">JSR-231
1.1.1a</a> and download the
appropriate files for your platform. For instance, if on windows,
download
      </p>

      <ul style="list-style-type: square;">

        <li>jogl-1.1.1a-windows-i586.zip</li>

        <li>jogl-1.1.1a-src.zip (to have access to javadoc in
Eclipse)</li>

        <li>jogl-1.1.1a-docs.zip (if you prefer reading javadoc
in your browser) </li>

      </ul>

      <p>To make your life more pleasant in Eclipse, you want to
attach the source code to the jar for the javadoc. First add the jar to
your build path, then open up Reference Libraries in your project,
right click on the jar to set properties, go to source code attachment,
and tell it where to find the zip file. Note that the .dll (or .so)
that comes with the jar must be in your path. You can do this by
opening the reference libraries in your project, right clicking to
select properties, choose Native Library and enter the location of the
.dll or .so file. &nbsp;You can also do this by adding
the&nbsp;folder containing the shared library to your path.</p>

      <p>To complete most assignments you will likely need to use
the <i>vecmath</i> jar for working with matrices, points,
and vectors. The <i>vecmath</i> package is available as
part of JAVA3D, but
<!-- <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/java3d/index.jsp">Java3D</a>-->instead
of installing the full Java3D, you can download just the <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F10/a0/vecmath.jar">vecmath.jar</a>
locally. The source code (i.e., the javadoc) is in the jar, so if it
isn't automatically attached, you'll want to repeat the process above
and attach the jar as source. You might also want to browse the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/java3d/forDevelopers/J3D_1_3_API/j3dapi/index.html">vecmath
javadoc online</a>.</p>

      <p>You do not need to submit anything for assignment zero.
&nbsp;However, if you are new to WebCT, you may wish to test the
submission process, and as such there is a test assignment called A0 on
WebCT. &nbsp;Note that you should always check that the system has
correctly received your uploaded files by downloading your submission
and verifying its contents! You can always "take back your work" before
the deadline and resubmit. &nbsp;Once the deadline has passed,
you'll not be able to do this. &nbsp;Late &nbsp;assignment
submissions are permitted, but can only be made if you have not
previously submitted an assignment. &nbsp;If ever you have problems
submitting your work, contact the instructor or one of the TAs. </p>
