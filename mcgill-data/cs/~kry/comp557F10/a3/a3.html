  <p>In this assignment you will build half edge data structures from
  polygon soups, and subdivide meshes using the Catmull-Clark subdivision
  scheme.  The polygon soup loader has been written for you and is
  very minimal.  It will load the vertex and face data from an 'obj'
  file (though these files can also contain lots of other information
  too).  We have also provided you with a number of sample meshes that
  will be useful for testing your program.</p>

  <h3 class="section">Provided Code</h3>

  <p>Download the sample code from WebCT.  It is a 
<!--The <a href="a2.zip">sample code</a> is a --> working program that
  will load one of the sample polygon soups and will draw it.  You will
  need to add the jogl, vecmath, and mintools jars to your project.
  The sample code zip file has the following contents.

  <ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>
  A3App
  </em></span>

  <p>The main application loads a polygon soup, will make calls to try
  to build a half edge data structure and will try to subdivide it
  (these method calls will fail because you need to implement them).
  The display call will draw the coarse polygon mesh by default, and
  also draws a half edge of the coarsest half edge data structure.
  You can use the keyboard interface to walk the half edge data
  structure.  Press space to go to the twin and N for the next half
  edge.  Left and Right arrows will take you to first and second child
  (if they exist), while up arrow will take you to the parent (if it
  exists).  Home and end keys can be used to change the subdivision
  level currently displayed, while page up and page down will allow
  you to go forwards and backwards in the model list (the model is
  loaded and subdivided each time).</P> </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>
  PolygonSoup
  </em></span>

  <p>Contains a vertexList and a faceList, and code to load these from
  an obj file.  There is also some simple drawing code used by the
  <em>A3App</em> class to draw the loaded soup.</p>
  </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>
  HalfEdge
  </em></span>

  <p>The half edge class is simple, and provided for you.  It has 6
  pointers (<em>next, head, twin, child1, child2, parent</em>), and a method
  for drawing a half edge to help you verify that your program is
  working.  For your convenience, it also contains a <em>prev</em>
  method to get the previous half edge.</p> </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>
  Vertex
  </em></span>

  <p>The vertex class is simply a container to hold the position of the
  vertex, the normal (if it has been computed), and a pointer to its 
  subdivision child (if it exists).</p>
  </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>
  Face
  </em></span>

  <p>The face class is a simple container for the face normal 
  (for flat shading), a pointer to the half edge, and a pointer to
  its subdivision child (a vertex) if it exists.  The constructor will
  compute the normal and set all the <em>leftFace</em> pointers of the
  half edge loop appropriately.</p>
  </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>
  HEDS <b>(you need to finish this class)</b>
  </em></span>

  <p>HEDS is the Half Edge Data Structure, and simply contains a list
  of faces (each face has a half edge loop).  You will need to
  implement the constructor which builds the structure given a polygon
  soup</p> </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>
  CatmullClark <b>(you need to finish this class)</b>
  </em></span>

  </P>This class has one method called subdivide which takes a half
  edge data structure and returns the half edge data structure for the
  subdivided mesh.  You will need to implement this method, and will
  likely want to create several private static helper methods to
  complete the objectives described below.</P> </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>
  Sample Geometry
  </em></span>

  <p>A number of sample obj files are included.  All of the samples
  are orientable manifolds, or orientable manifolds with boundary, and
  work with the provided soup loader.  Some consist only of
  quadrilaterals, while others are a mix of triangles and
  quadrilaterals.  You should test with simple models such as the
  torus and cube before trying out the money and human models.
  Several are meshes that involve boundary and should only be used if
  you decide to complete the 6th objective. Feel free to add your own
  models or modify these as you please.</li>

  </ul>

  </div>
 
<h2 class="section">Steps and Objectives</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

  <p>In these first steps, assume that your mesh is a closed
  orientable manifold, and as such, your half edges will always have a
  non null twin pointer (i.e., assume no boundaries).  For steps 2 and
  3, refer to Figure 4.8 on page 76 of
  the <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~dzorin/sig00course/">siggraph
  2000 course notes on subdividion surfaces</a>.  For the normals in
  step 5 refer to Equation 4.1 on Page 71.  Many meshes will not be
  exclusively quads.  You should deal with these problem cases by
  using a modification of the subdivision rules.  See the description
  starting at the bottom of page 76 and continuing on page 77.  For
  this assignment it is fine to use simplified versions of these rules
  as discussed in class, and we can note that after one subdivision
  all faces will have 4 sides.</p>

<ol>
<li> 
<img style="padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F10/a3/he-animation.gif" border="0" align="right">

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Half Edge Data Structure (two marks)</em></span></p>

<p>Write code that builds the half edge data structure.  You will
probably want to keep track of the half edges you create as you make
them so that you can easily connect each half edge with its twin. One
simple and somewhat inefficient approach would be to use
<em>Map&lt;String,HalfEdge&gt;</em> where "i,j" is the key for the edge from
vertex i to vertex j.  An alternative mentioned in class would be to
maintain a list of half edges leaving each vertex and match up the
twins as you find them.</p>

<p>You can test that your structure is correct by using the interface
that the <em>A3App</em> provides for walking the data structure (space
for twin and N for next). Once you have your half edge data structure
working, set the default value of the <em>drawCoarse</em> parameter in
the <em>A3App</em> to false (so that you can avoid unchecking this
parameter in the interface on each subsequent run).</p>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Even Vertices (two marks)</em></span></p>

<img style="padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F10/a3/plane-rgb2.png" border="0" align="right">
<p>Write code to compute the new position of the existing vertices in
the subdivided model (i.e., compute the even vertices).  You might do
this by visiting each face, and then computing the vertex child if it
has not already been computed.</p>

<p>You do not need to return a completed <em>HEDS</em> in
the <em>CatmullClark.subdivide</em> call.  Instead, check that you are
getting the expected result by checking the "display child vertices"
checkbox in the controls.  Code to draw the child vertices (if they
exist) is already in the provided code (see the bottom of the half
edge data structure class).  Even vertices are drawn as red
points.</p> </li>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Odd Vertices (two marks)</em></span></p>

<p>Write code to compute the odd vertices by subdividing the half
edges of every face.  Odd vertices are created at each edge and in the
center of each face.</p>

<p>The face child vertex is easiest to compute (it is the average of
the vertices).  Use the "display child vertices" to make sure that
these vertices are in the correct positions.  They will be drawn as
blue points.</p>

The edge child vertices are slightly more involved.  The <em>head</em>
of <em>child1</em> should point to the new vertex, while
the <em>head</em> of <em>child2</em> should point to the child vertex
of the half edge you are subdividing (i.e., one of the <b>even</b>
child vertices you created in step 2).  Be sure to set the parent
pointers on the children that you create.  In contrast, do not worry
about setting next pointers at this step (see step 4).  As such, you
will not yet be able to display these new half edges using the <em>A3App</em>
keyboard interface.</p>

<p>Make sure that you also create children of the twin edge, hook the
children up to each other with their twin pointers.  Be sure to get
the connections correct, i.e., child1's twin is its parent's twin's
child2.</p>

<p>Use the "display child vertices" checkbox to make sure that the
child vertices appear to be in the correct positions.  Odd vertices
created by edge subdivision are drawn as green points.</p>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Connectivity (two marks)</em></span></p>

<p>In this step you'll finish building the half edge data structure
for the subdivided mesh.  To do this, you will need to create the 8
child half edges that fall into the middle of each face (their parent
is a face rather than an edge, so leave the parent pointer null).  You
will need to set their head, next, and twin pointers, and also set the
next pointers of all the other child half edges in each face.  You
will also need to create the child faces, each of which will be a
quad.  Normally there will be 4 child faces, but if the source mesh
has n-gons, then you will be generating n child faces at this point!

<p>Use the keyboard controls to walk between the parent and child half
edge data structures to make sure you have connected everything
correctly.  Keeping your code as simple as possilbe and drawing
yourself pictures will likely help you succeed with connecting up all
the pointers correctly in this step.</p>

<li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Normals</em></span></p>

<p>Once you have a correctly connected data structure for the
subdivided mesh, you can compute normals of the limit surface.  Refer
to Equation 4.1 on Page 70 of the <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~dzorin/sig00course/">siggraph 2000 course
notes on subdividion surfaces</a> (note that vertex order is important
for getting your normal in the correct direction).  When you set the
normal of a vertex, it will be used by the display method of the HEDS
class to draw the object with smooth shading.</p>

  </li>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Boundaries (optional, 5% bonus)</em></span></p>

<p>Quite often, we deal with meshes that have boundaries, and in these
cases you will have half edges that have no twin.  Write code that
detects this, and implements the boundary subdivision rules.  For
instance, before subdividing a vertex, you probably compute the
valence of the vertex by walking the half edges that arrive at that
vertex; use the boundary subdivision rule if you come across a null
twin pointer.</p>

<p>You will also need to modify your code that computes the vertex
normals in a similar way.  Refer to equation 4.2 on page 72 of the
subdivision course notes as a guide.  Note the typo for k=3, and
modify the k>=4 case so that you compute a weighted sum of vectors (as
opposed to working with weighted points).  Resolve any ambiguity with
respect to this on the WebCT discussion board.
</p>

<p>Note again that this objective is optional.  That is, you are not
required to complete this step.  It is suggested that you only
complete this objective if you finished the others too quickly.</p>

  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
  <em>Readme File</em></span>

       <p> Create a <em>readme.txt</em> or <em>readme.pdf</em> file to
       submit with your assignment.  The readme should include any
       comments you have with respect to the assignment, and describes
       anything you deem to be noteworthy.  Try to be brief!  Your
       readme should also contain a written answer to the following
       question:</p>

       <ol type=a>
       <li><p>The monkey head model has 32 triangles and 468
       quadrilaterals for a total of 500 faces.  How many faces will
       there be after 2 levels of subdivision.  Give a formula, or
       clearly explain your computation.  If you implement step 6,
       then you can also check your answer with your
       implementation!</p></li> </ol>
