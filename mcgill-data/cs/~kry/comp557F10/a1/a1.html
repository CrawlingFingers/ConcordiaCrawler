<h1>COMP 557 - Fall 2010 - Assignment 1<br>
Transform Hierarchy for Character Posing</h1>
</div>


<h2 class="section">Due 12:00 noon Monday 27 September</h2>

<h2 class="section">Getting Started</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

  <p>Download the <!-- <a href="a1.zip">provided code</a> --> provided
  code from WebCT and dump it into a new java project. Follow the
  instructions in assignment zero for setting up your environment.
  Note that the provided code contains a jar called <em>mintools</em>.
  We will be using more of these helper classes in subsequent
  assignments, but for now, we are only using the
  <em>TrackBallCamera</em> class.  The provided code attaches an
  instance of this class to the glCanvas so that mouse events can be
  used to alter the 3D view.  Using the left mouse button you can
  rotate the object, using the middle button you can pan the object in
  the viewing plane, and using the right mouse button you can move the
  camera further or closer.</p>

  <p>Start early!  This assignment is not supposed to be hard, or time 
  consuming, yet it is possible to get caught up on various details.</p>

  </div>

<h2 class="section">Objectives
</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

<img style="padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;" src="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F10/a1/wood.png" border="0" align="right"></a>
  <p>The purpose of this assignment is to use a hierarchy of
  transformations to draw and animate a character.  You can use a
  variety of objects to build your character.  Using glut to draw
  spheres, cubes, cones, cylinders, and the occasional teapot will be
  easiest.  If you also want to draw triangles and quadrilaterals, you
  will need to specify their surface normal for lighting to work.</p>

  <p>The file A1App.java contains the necessary source code to create
  an OpenGL renderer in a windowed frame.  A reasonable camera
  position and projection matrix is set up for you (see the use of the
  <em>TrackBallCamera</em> instance in the display method).  The code
  also contains <b>TODO</b> comments in the places where you will need
  to add code to complete the assignment objectives that are given
  below.</p>

  <p>Each objective is worth one mark, unless otherwise noted.</p>

  <ol>
  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Create Scene Graph Nodes</em></span>

       <p>
       Finish writing the scene graph node class called
       <em>BodyNode</em>.  The node should have a display method to
       draw the contents of the node and all its children (which are
       also <em>BodyNode</em>s).  In each node, you may want to store:
       </p>

       <ul><li>position with respect to its parent;</li>
           <li>rotation axis for the joint connecting this node to its parent;</li>
	   <li>current rotation angle;
           <li>a list of children (possibly the empty list);</li>
           <li>colour, i.e., material properties of the geometry of this node;
           <li>position, scale, orientation, and geometry information for this node.</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Note that as described in the list above, the rotation axis
       for the joint, and the position of the node with respect to its
       parent, describe a rigid transformation.  The transformation
       describes the local coordinate frame in which the geometry of
       this node and its children are drawn.  In the last bullet item,
       you can consider the position, scale, and orientation as
       additional modeling transforms to help you to place your
       desired canonical glut primitives (sphere, torus, cube, etc.).
       </p></li>

       <p>This is similar to how we saw the scene graph organized in
       class, except that we are mixing many transforms, material
       properties, and geometry in each node.  The idea here is to
       simplify things slightly, but feel free to modify this as you
       see fit (be careful that your modifications work nicely with
       the rest of the objectives of the assignment).  For instance,
       you may find it conceptually cleaner to keep the geometry in a
       separate type of node (i.e., create another class, such as a
       <em>GeometryNode</em>, to store the bottom two bullet items in
       the above list).

  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
  <img style="padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;" src="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F10/a1/chain.png" align="right">
  <em>Create and Animate a Chain (two marks)</em></span>
 
       <p> Write code such that when the 'C' key is pressed, a chain
          is created.  The chain should be a reasonable length (e.g.,
          5 to 10 links), where each link is a torus.  Choose your
          glutSolidTorus parameters so that you get something that
          resembles a chain link, and such that your chain is an
          appropriate size to be seen on the screen (i.e., without
          need of using the mouse to moving the camera from the
          default position).  Each link should be rotated 90 degrees
          from its parent, and placed such that it appears to be
          hanging from its parent (see the screen shot at right).</p>

       <p>Each link should rotate as if it is sliding at the point of
          contact of its parent.  You have two options, and can do
          either (or both, though doing both is obviously hardest).
          The easier option is to use the axis of rotation that goes
          through the center of the torus; this will produce a
          rotation which is only visible via the motion of its
          children (i.e., the torus will be rotating in place).  The
          other option is to apply a rotation with an rotation axis
          on, and tangent to, the <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=medial+axis">medial
          axis<a> of the torus (i.e., at the point at center of the
          tube above the point of contact, and tangent to the circle
          at the center of the tube); this rotation will be visible
          both at the children and the torus itself.  Note that the
          third axis (the overall direction of the chain) is not a
          good choice for rotations in the chain because twists along
          the chain direction quickly result in interpenetration.</p>
          
       <p>Use the space bar to toggle the animation mode.  The
          provided code has an animation mode that sets all the angles
          to a sinusoid based on the current time to test your chain.
          It should appear to be swinging.</p>

       Create an articulated character when the user presses the <a TITLE="Why? D is close to C!">'D'</a>
       key.  You can choose to make anything you like (e.g., animal,
       human, robot), but it should have at least two legs, two arms,
       and a head.  In all you should have about 20 degrees of freedom
       in your character.</p>

       <p>You will likely find it useful to first make a sketch of
       your character to figure out how each of its body parts are
       connected to one another and where.  Note that you will also
       need to choose a reasonable root node for the character, such
       as the torso.  Write code to create the various body parts, and
       link them together by adding each child to the appropriate
       parent.  Be sure to also add all your nodes to the
       <em>nodeList</em>!  Note that you will want to avoid making a
       DAG so that all limbs of your character can be animated
       separately. </p>
       
       <p>Some joints should have a single degree of freedom (as shown
       in the picture above left), such as knees and elbows, while you
       should also have other joints which have multiple degrees of
       freedom (e.g., hips, shoulders, neck).  You can create your
       multi-DOF joints any way you like, but it should work with the
       posing and animation controls in subsequent steps.  One easy
       way to achieve a spherical joint would be to create three nodes
       all at the same location with different rotation axes.  Two of
       the three nodes need not have any geometry associated with
       them, i.e., you would have two "invisible" nodes at the anchor
       position of the ball in socket joint show in the picture above
       right.
       </p>
       </li>

  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
  <em>Posing Controls and Setting Key Frames</em></span>
     
       <p>
       The provided code contains a primitive means of changing the
       pose of your character.  The provided code uses the left and
       right arrow keys to walk through the <em>nodeList</em>, and then
       use up down arrows to adjust the angle by small increments
       (perhaps a few degrees).</p>

       <p>You may find it useful to try to find a way to modify the
       code so that the currently selected node is drawn in a
       different style or colour.
       </p>

       <p> Add code to save the current pose when you press 'K'.  Save
       the pose into the existing list of "key poses".  Code already
       exists to erase, load and save your key poses using keys 'E',
       'L', and 'S'.  Any code you add should work with the provided
       code, or you should fix it so that it works with your
       implementation.</p>

       <p> Note that using OpenGL picking to select which body part
       you want to pose would be a great way to simplify the task of
       character posing.  This is beyond the scope of this assignment,
       but can be implemented for a 5% bonus!

       <!-- could add this back, and other objectives for a 3 week assignment -->

  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
  <em>Key Frame Animation</em></span>
     
       <p>
       Create a simple key-frame animation.  Plan ahead!  The key pose
       editing functions are very limited (i.e., there is no undo,
       redo, insert, replace, delete, etc.).  Try to make a reasonable
       walk cycle using at least four key poses.  Save the animation
       and submit the resulting <em>keyposes.javabin</em> file with
       your code.  Consider adding additional keyboard controls to
       increase or decrease the speed of the keyframe animation
       (currently the time between keyframes is half a second).

  <em>Readme File (two marks)</em></span>
     
       <p>
       Create a <em>readme.txt</em> or <em>readme.pdf</em> file to
       submit with your assignment.  The readme should include any
       comments you have with respect to the assignment, and describes
       anything you deem to be noteworthy.  Try to be brief!  Your
       readme should also contain written answers to the following
       questions:</p>

       <ol type=a>
       <li><p>Is setting the joint angles individually always a good
       interface for setting key poses?  What do you think would be a
       useful alternative?  Try to think of at least one alternative,
       but list several if you can.</p></li>

       <li><p>For the following pairs of transformation types, do they
       commute <b>always</b>, <b>sometimes</b>, or <b>never</b>?
       Always means always, while never means only if one or both are
       the identity transformation.  Sometimes means that the
       transforms do not commute in general, however, there are
       situations where two transforms will commute.  If your answer
       is sometimes, then describe, as concisely and as generally as
       possible the situation where commutability will occur.</p>

         <ul>
         <li> Rotation and Scale in 2D</li>
