<h1>COMP 557 - Fall 2009 - Assignment 2<br>
Bezier Surfaces</h1>
</div>


<h2 class="section">Due 23:59 pm Friday 9 October</h2>

<h2 class="section">Getting Started</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

  <p>The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate Bezier surfaces and
  to draw smooth objects using OpenGL. </p>

  <p>The Bezier surfaces in this assignment are bicubic polynomials of
  order 3 in each parameter, thus each patch is defined by a 4 by 4
  grid of control points.  Unlike a triangle mesh, a Bezier surface
  patch is smooth, differentiable, and its shape is entirely specified
  by its 16 control points.  However, to draw such a smooth surface in
  OpenGL we must approximate the smooth surface with small primitives
  (e.g., triangles or quads).  You will do this by evaluating the
  surface at regular intervals along the s and t directions, and
  drawing triangles or quads.</p>

  <p>Note that OpenGL can draw polynomial surfaces through the use of
  evaluators. In the assignment, we ask you not to use OpenGL
  evaluators, but rather to implement your own code to evaluate the
  surface and its derivatives given values of the parameters s and
  t.</p>

  <h3 class="section">Provided Code</h3>

  <p>The <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F09/a2/a2.zip">sample code</a> runs, but does nothing but
  draw a world axis and calls a collection of methods in the
  BezierPatchWork class that you need to complete.  The sample code
  zip file has the following contents.

  <ul>

  <li>A2App and BezierPatchwork java files, which need to be placed in
  a package called comp557a2, and you will need to add the jogl and
  vecmath jars to your project as per the previous assignment.</li>

  <li>mintools.jar, which also needs to added to your classpath as it
  provides a small framework used by the sample code.  

  <li>Three data files.  The file testPatch.txt contains one single
  flat Bezier patch.  The file testPatches.txt contains two Bezier
  patches.  The third contains Bezier patches defining the Utah
  teapot.  Change the constructor of A2App to run your application
  with different data files.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>The code (BezierPatchWork.java) contains TODO comments in the
  places where you will need to add code to complete the assignment
  objectives specified below.  The A2App code sets up the interface
  and adds a number of swing controls to a control window.  You will
  use these controls to turn on or off or adjust the display different
  things as specified in the objectives.</p>

  <h3 class="section">mintools Framework Jar</h3>

  <p>While it is easy enough to start writing code from scratch when
  building a new application, many small parts of code are always the
  same.  The mintools.jar provides classes that help set up an
  interactive application.  It takes care of clearing the screen,
  setting up lights, and provides a simple interface.  In particular,
  you can use the mouse to rotate and zoom the object: Left click and
  drag to rotate, middle click and drag to translate, right click and
  drag to zoom.</p>

  <h3 class="section">Bezier Patch Data</h3>

  <p>The teapot is composed of 32 Bezier patches, each with a 4 by 4
  grid of control points for a total of 16 control points each. You
  will notice that the BezierPatchWork class already contains code for
  loading all this data into an array of Matrix4d objects.  Each
  matrix contains the 16 control points of a given patch for a
  given axis (x, y, or z).  For instance, Gx, the 4 by 4 matrix of x
  coordinates of control points of the first patch will be found in
  coordinatePatch[0][0], while the y coordinates are in
  coordinatePatch[0][1], and z in coordinatePatch[0][2].  This code is
  provided as a convenience to help you get started faster.  But if
  you feel strongly about storing your control points in some other
  manner then feel free to change it!</p>

  </div>
 
<h2 class="section">Steps and Objectives</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

<ol>
<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Control Points</em></span></p>

The drawControlPoints(gl,patch) method of BezierPatchWork is currently
unfinished.  Add code to draw the control points using GL_POINTS.
Make the points large and red by setting the colour with glColor and
the point size with glPointSize.  The "Display Control Points"
checkbox in the controls window will let you enable drawing.  Make
sure it is checked when you are testing your code (it is on by
default).</li>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Surface</em></span></p>

<p>The <i>draw(gl,patch)</i> method of BezierPatchWork is also
unfinished.  Implement this method by drawing the specified patch as a
mesh of quadrilaterals or triangles.  You should make
<i>numEvaluations.getValue()</i> evaluations at regular intervals
along each parameter direction.  You can think of each interval as
defining a small rectangular region of the surface, which you can draw
as a quad or a pair of triangles.</p>

<p>Note that you will probably want to write a number of additional
methods to help you compute Bernstein basis weights.  Also note that
the "Display Bezier Mesh" checkbox must be checked when you are
testing your code (it is checked by default).
</p>
</li>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Tangents</em></span></p>

Write code to compute the surface tangents (i.e., the derivatives in
the s and t directions).  Write code in the drawSurfaceVectors method
to draw the s and t derivitives as red and green lines at the surface
point (s,t) provided in the parameters.  Note that the default state
of the controls is not to call this method.  Use the s and t sliders
in the controls window to check that your tangent vectors make sense.

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Normals</em></span></p>

Write code to compute surface normals using your code that computes
tangent vectors.  Compute a normal for each surface point you evaluate
in objective 2, and modify the patch drawing code so that the normal
is sent to OpenGL.  Note that the normal must be set with glNormal
before calling glVertex!  Use the lighting checkbox in the control
window to turn on lighting to check your result.

<li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Repair Bad Normals</em></span></p>

Note that some surface points have bad normals, notably the top and
bottom of the teapot.  Why is this happening?  Write some code to
check for when this is happening, and use a nearby point of the
surface to approximate the desired value of the bad normal.  Note that
your "fix" need not work in all cases, but should work in the case of
the teapot data.  </li>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Surface Coordinate Axis</em></span></p>

Add more code to the drawSurfaceVectors method to compute a coordinate
frame on the surface of the patch.  The local coodrinate system should
have its x axis in the direction of the s tangent, the z axis in the
direction of the normal, and the appropriate y axis to form a right
handed coordinate system.  Use glMultMatrix to change to this
coordinate system, and draw a wire cube with glutWireCube(0.1).  Be
sure to use glPush and glPop so that you can restore the state of the
modelview matrix when you have finished drawing the cube.

  <li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Shadow Projection</em></span></p>

       <p>A trick for drawing shadows is to project geometry onto a
       surface using the light position as the center of projection.
       Once the geometry is flattened in the shape of a shadow on the
       surface it can be drawn in a dark colour.</p>

       <p>Let the plane with normal N and going through point C be the
       surface, and let L be the position of the light.  Let P be a
       point to be projected onto the plane.</p>

       <p>The implicit equation of the plane (use N dot (X - C) = 0 as
       the equation of your plane).  Substitute the parametric
       equation of the line from the light to the given point P into
       the equation of the plane, and solve the parameter value which
       gives the point on the surface.  Give a simple expression for
       this parameter value.</p>

       <p>What is the position of the projected point (i.e., subsitute
       the solved parameter value into the line equation)?  </p>

       <p>Your answer for the projected point involves a division, but
       instead write the answer in homogenous coordinates so that the
       conversion from homogeneous to non-homogenous coordinates will
       perform this division.  Keep your answer in terms of vectors
       and dot products!</p>



  <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Bezier Hermite Basis Conversion</em></span></p>

    <p>The kth derivative at the end of a Bezier curve C(t) depends on
    the positions of the k+1 control points at that end.  Show this to
    be true for the 1st derivitive of a Bezier curve, and therefore
    demonstrate that C'(0) is parallel to P1 - P0 (and likewise, that
    C'(1) is parallel to the vector formed by the last two control
    points).  Use your answer to write the change of basis matrices
    that go from cubic Bezier to Hermite, and from Hermite to cubic
    Bezier.</p>
