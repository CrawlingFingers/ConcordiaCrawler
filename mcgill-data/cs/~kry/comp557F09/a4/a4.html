Ray Tracing</h1>

<h2 class="section">Milestone Due 23:59 pm Monday 16 November</h2>

<h2 class="section">Complete Assignment Due 23:59 pm Monday 30 November</h2>

<h2 class="section">New Details (November 13)</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

  <p>This assignment has been combined with assignment 5 and it will
  be worth double a normal assignment, that is, 16% of the final
  grade.  Rather than giving an extension you must still make a
  submission of a milestone for the original deadline, with the
  complete assignment to be submitted by the end of Monday November
  30.<p/>

  <p>The Milestone requirement is that you must have completed the
  first 3 steps of the <em> original </em> assignment.  There will be
  a penalty of 20% for milestones which are incomplete or not
  submitted. Submit the following three things: a snapshot of your
  <b>code</b> along with a <b>scene</b> xml file and resulting
  <b>image</b> which demonstrates the requirement.</p>

  <p>
  The <em>new</em> requirements for the complete assignment is that you must 
  implement the following extensions:</p>

  <ol>

  <li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Jittered Super Sampling</em></span></p>

  <p>This need not be adaptive, but you should consider each of
  jittering and super sampling separately by adding additional tags to
  your scene file to enable or disable them independently.  

  <p>For super sampling, you will want to sample the image at regular
  locations within each pixel, as if you were building an image at
  twice the resolution (or some other resolution).  But you should
  also observe how some high frequency aliasing problems can still
  exist.</p>

  <p>Observe how adding a small random perturbation to the
  direction of each ray fixes the aliasing problem.  The amount of 
  random perturbation should be configured in your xml scene file. </p>

  <p>Note that you naturally have high frequency details in your
  scenes, such as edges.  Likewise if you implement textures
  (optional) then the aliasing problems should be even more evident.
  You should also try putting high frequency details in your
  background colour computation as an easy test, for instance,
  choosing a colour modulated by cos(k*(x^2+y^2)) would give low
  frequency when looking down the negative z axis, but will have
  higher frequency as you cast rays away from this axis (adjust k so
  you can observe the aliasing effect).  Again, you might want to make
  this an option so that you are not stuck with the same background in
  all your test images!</P>

  <li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Simple Acceleration for Meshes</em></span></p> 

  <p>Compute an axis aligned bounding box for each mesh in your scene.
  Test first ray intersection with the box before testing all
  triangles in the mesh.  Make sure that you can turn on or off your
  acceleration method.  Measure the improvement for your sample scene
  and report on the improvement in your readme and on your submitted
  web page (see below).
  </p>

  <li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Area Lights and Soft Shadows</em></span></p>

  <p> Define a new tag for an area light where you specify its
  position and shape as a quadrilateral in world coordinates.  Cast
  several shadow rays to random positions on the area to compute a
  weighted lighting computation.  Note that the number of rays you
  cast should be configurable in the lamp definition, but you could
  optionally optimize the number of rays you cast depending on the
  distance between the light and the surface being lit. </p>

  </ol>

  <p>Note that the bonus items listed below have been adjusted slightly,
  and you can still implement extra features for extra credit.</p>

  <h3 class="section">Final Submission Format</h3>

  <p>You should create and submit a web page (that is the files, not
  just a link!) along with your assignment submission which contains
  images that demonstrate each requirement of the assignment, along
  with demonstrating the extra features you implemented.  </p>

  <p>While you could probably create one image to show all of your
  features at once, it is suggested that you take some time to create
  a variety of nice test scenes and render several images. Some images
  should be plain and simple to demonstrate individual features.
  Other images should be more complex and demonstrate a creative use
  of your software to generate interesting images.</p>

  <p>Each image on your submitted web page should include a caption
  that gives the name of the xml scene file you used to generate the
  image, the computation time to generate the image, a list of
  features demonstrated in the image, and any additional comments.
  You may also want to list your hardware and operating system to help
  give meaning to the timings for each image.  Note that the images
  should be a reasonable size, for instance, 640x480 is sufficient for
  showing many of the features, but you may optionally want to compute
  higher resolution images for your final scene, but do not go higher
  than 1920x1200.<p>

  <p>Note that we may also run your code, but largely evaluation of
  your assignment will be done by inspecting the web page and your
  submitted code.  Submitting an image that was not generated by your
  code is considered cheating. Because raytracers may take a long time
  to generate a given image the TAs may only selectively run specific
  examples, and it is largely on your honor that the images you show
  are yours (do not violate this trust).</p>

  <h3 class="section">Optional Competition</h3>

There will be optional competition for images created with your
raytracer. You do not submit an image if you do not want to
participate.

To participate, you should submit a representative image, and a short
description describing the technical achievements and or artist
statement for your submission.  Submit the image and statement to the
competition assignment box by the end of Monday 30 November.

A small jury will judge submissions based on aesthetics, creativity,
and technical merit.  Winners will be announced in class on Tuesday 1
December.

<h2 class="section">Getting Started</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

  <p>In this assignment, you will write a raytracer.  Note that there
  is no written part to this assignment. The <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F09/a4/a4.zip">sample
  code</a> will get you started with an XML scene file parser and code
  to write PPM image file.  The XML scene format is very very loosely
  based off of the Yafaray format, but is simplified and modified for
  the purpose of this assignment.  You are free to make additional
  modifications and extensions as you please to both the XML format
  and the code, but your code should still work with the simple
  examples provided, and likewise, any changes you make must be well
  documented in your readme file.</p>

  <h3 class="section">XML scene description</h3>

  <p>The XML file is organized as sequence of named materials, lights,
  cameras, nodes, and renders.  The main scene is defined in the node
  with the name "root".  In general you will only need to have one
  node defined, and it must have the name "root", but nodes can also
  be referred to within the scene graph hierarchy as an instance
  (i.e., to help you reuse parts of the scene hierarchy multiple
  times).  

  <p>The scene nodes each have an associated transformation.  The node
  definition can contains a list of transformations (translation,
  rotx, roty, rotz, and scale (and others if you choose to add them)).
  These transformations are applied in order to build the node
  transformation.  The node can also list a number of different kinds
  of geometry (sphere, cube, mesh, instance).  Finally, the node can
  also contain a list of child nodes, allowing a hierarchy of
  transformations and geometry to be built.

  <p>Look at the two examples provided to get a better idea of how the
  scene description files are organized.  Please share your test
  scenes on WebCT.  Note that you may also implement additional tags
  and attributes as you proceed through the objectives, so this may
  complicate sharing. </p>

  <h3 class="section">Provided Code</h3>

  A4App opens an xml document and calls the Scene constructor to load
  the scene definition from the xml file.  It then calls the scene
  render method to produce an image file.  This render method is a
  good place to start making changes to the code, but you will need to
  make lots of changes to many classes, and make new classes on your
  own.  You've been provided with basic classes for defining a
  materials, lights, and nodes, but they do nothing but hold loaded
  data.  A Ray class and an intersection result have been defined for
  your convenience, but you may wish to change them.  They are defined
  to allow the Intersectable interface to be defined.  The sphere,
  cube, plane, mesh, or any other geometry (or node) that can be
  intersected will implement this interface.

  </div>
 
<h2 class="section">Steps and Objectives</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

<ol>
<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Generate Rays</em></span></p>

<p>The sample takes you up to the point where you need to compute the
rays to intersect with the scene.  Use the camera definition to build
the rays you need to cast into the scene.  You should have a default
background for when rays do not intersect objects, and this should not
be a solid colour.  Choose some pleasing background colour based on
your ray direction or pixel coordinate.
</p>
</li>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Sphere Intersection</em></span></p>

<p>The simplest scene includes a single sphere at the origin.  Write
the code to perform the sphere intersection and set the colour to be
either black or white depending on the result (i.e., don't worry about
lighting in this first step).  Implement an additional position
attribute for the sphere tag so that you can create a scene with
several spheres at different positions without using the
transformation tags (see step 7).  For instance, &lt;sphere
radius="0.5" position="0 0 0" material="red"/&gt;.
</p>
</li>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Lighting</em></span></p>

<p>Modify your code so that you're always keeping track of the closest
intersection, and the material, and the normal.  Use this information
to compute the colour of each pixel by summing the contribution of
each of the lights in the xml file.
</p>
</li>


<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Shadows</em></span></p>

<p>Modify your lighting code to compute a shadow ray, and test that
the light is not occluded before applying computing and adding the
light contribution in the previous step.
</p>
</li>



<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Cube</em></span></p>

<p>Add code to create an intersectable Cube object.  The cube should
be axis aligned, centered at the origin, and with edges of length
specified in the XML file, i.e., &lt;cube size="1" material="red"&gt;.
</p>
</li>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Triangle Meshes</em></span></p>

<p> The provided code include the polygon soup loader from the
previous assignment.  You can use this loader, or extend it, or write
something new to load the obj file specified in the mesh XML nodes.
Note that you do not have vertex normals by default, so flat shaded
triangles are fine (though Phong shading would be nice).
</p>
</li>

<li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Hierarchy and Instances</em></span></p>

<p> Use the transformations defined in the scene nodes to transform
the rays before intersecting the geometry and child nodes.  Be sure to
also transform the normals of the intersection result that you return
to the caller.  Implement the instance tag to reuse named subtrees of
the hierarchy.  Do something reasonable with the material definition
of an instance (i.e., replace the material of the intersection, or
modulate the colours).
</p>
</li>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Create a Novel Scene</em></span></p>

<p>Create a unique scene of your own.  Be creative.  Try to have some
amount of complexity to make it interesting (i.e., different shapes
and different materials).  Your scene should demonstrate all features
of your ray tracer.  Note that there will be a separate submission for
the ray tracing competition later in the term.
</p>
</li>


<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Bonus</em></span></p>

<p> Implement some extra feature (or features) in your ray tracer, and
make sure that it is something of some minimum difficulty if you want
to receive full bonus marks.  Here is a list of thing you might
consider, but note that the items have been adjusted from the original
posting of this assignment to account for the new requirements of the
combined fourth and fifth assignments
