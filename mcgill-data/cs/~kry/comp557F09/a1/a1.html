<h1>COMP 557 - Fall 2009 - Assignment 1<br>
Getting Started with OpenGL</h1>
</div>


<h2 class="section">Due 23:39 pm Monday 21 September</h2>

<h2 class="section">Getting Started</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

  <p>Since this is the first assignment, you'll need to spend a little
  bit of time to get set up.  If you are not already using Java then
  download and install the latest <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java SE
  JDK</a> (careful not to select the JRE).  I also recommend using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> as a development
  environment.  If you do use Eclipse as a development environment,
  make sure that the compiler compliance level is set to 1.6
  (Project-&gt;Properties-&gt;Java Compiler).</p>
  
  Download the <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F09/a1/A1App.java">provided code</a> and dump it into
  a new java project.  Note that the code lives in the
  <i>comp557a1</i> package, so when you create your project you'll
  want to create the
  <i>comp557a1</i> package in your src folder before copying the file.
  Please do not change the package name, and likewise, add all your
  code to this one file (this assignment is small, so it should not be
  too messy living all in one file).
  
  The code uses <i>JOGL</i> for OpenGL bindings
<i>JOGL</i> is available at <a href="https://jogl.dev.java.net/">https://jogl.dev.java.net/</a>.
  Click on current release build (JSR-231 1.1.1a) and download the
  appropriate files for your platform.  If on windows, download

  <ul style="list-style-type: square;">        
    <li>jogl-1.1.1a-windows-i586.zip</li>
    <li>jogl-1.1.1a-src.zip (to have access to javadoc in Eclipse)</li>
    <li>jogl-1.1.1a-docs.zip (if you prefer reading javadoc in your browser) </li>
  </ul>

  <p>To make your life more pleasant in Eclipse, you want to attach
  the source code to the jar for the javadoc.  First add the jar to
  your build path, then open up Reference Libraries in your project,
  right click on the jar to set properties, go to source code
  attachment, and tell it where to find the zip file.  Note that the
  .dll (or .so) that comes with the jar must be in your path.  You can
  do this by opening the reference libraries in your project, right
  clicking to select properties, choose Native Library and enter the
  location of the .dll or .so file.</p>

  <p>To complete this assignment you will likely want to use the
  <i>vecmath</i> jar for working with matrices, points, and vectors.
  The <i>vecmath</i> package is available as part of JAVA3D, but

<!--  <a  href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/java3d/index.jsp">Java3D</a>-->

  instead of installing the full Java3D, you can download just the <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/%7Ekry/comp599/a1/vecmath.jar">vecmath.jar</a>
  locally.  The source code (i.e., the javadoc) is in the jar, so if
  it isn't automatically attached, you'll want to repeat the process
  above and attach the jar as source. You might also want to browse
  the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/java3d/forDevelopers/J3D_1_3_API/j3dapi/index.html">vecmath
  javadoc online</a>.</p>

  OpenGL: <a href="http://glprogramming.com/red/">The OpenGL
  Programming Guide (The Red Book) online version</a> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/OpenGL-Programming-Guide-Official-Learning/dp/0321173481">or

<h2 class="section">Objectives</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

  <p>The purpose of this assignment is to explore object space and
  world space rotations.  The completed assignment will let you apply
  small incremental x, y, and z rotations to a wire frame cube. The
  provided source code should help you get started quickly. The file
  A1App.java contains the necessary source code to create an OpenGL
  renderer in a windowed frame.  The a reasonable camera position and
  projection matrix is set up for you (see the display method).  The
  code also contains TODO comments in the places where you will need
  to add code to complete the assignment objectives that are given
  below. </p>

  <ol>
  <li> Write code to draw the world axis using three unit length lines
       starting at origin along the X Y and Z axis directions.  The
       color of the X axis should be red, the Y axis should be green
       and the Z axis should be blue.  </li>

  <li> Write code to draw a cube with edge length 2 using the function
       glut.glutWireCube(1).

  <li> Create a transformation matrix (i.e., vecmath Matrix4d), to map
       points in your cube object coordinates to world coordinates.
       Be sure to initially set your matrix to the identity, then use
       it when you draw your cube by changing the modelview matrix
       before drawing.  Note that you'll need to repackage the
       contents of the vecmath Matrix4d into a double[] or
       DoubleBuffer before passing it to OpenGL, so be careful of the
       order in which you specify matrix entries.</li>

  <li> Draw a second axis in the cube's coordinates.  Note that they will
       intitailly be aligned.</li>

  <li> The private variables "axisRotate", and
       "leftMultiplicationMode" are provided to let you control how to
       rotate the cube. These variables need to be updated given the
       following keyboard input:

        <ul>
	   <li>Arrow Up: apply a small positive rotation about the current axis.</li>
	   <li>Arrow Down: apply a negative rotation about the current axis.</li>
	   <li>X: Set the default rotation axis to the 'X' axis</li>
	   <li>Y: Set the default rotation axis to the 'Y' axis</li>
	   <li>Z: Set the default rotation axis to the 'Z' axis</li>
	   <li>Space: toggle the left/right matrix multiplication mode.</li>
	   <li>R: Reset the accumulated transformation to the identity.</li>
	</ul>

      Choose a small reasonable value for the angle update, for
      instance something between 1 and 5 degrees.  The rotation should
      be accumulated.  Note that M.mul(M,Rx) is generally safe with
      vecmath as it checks to see if you're passing the object itself
      as one of the arguments.  Be sure to use the repaint method to request
      a redraw of the canvas after each keypress.</li>

  <li> Optional step: implement code to select between translation,
       scale, and rotation modes using they keyboard.  Use 1 to select
       rotation, 2 to select scale, and 3 to select translation.  Be
       sure to choose reasonable values for each type of
       transformation.  Change the glutBitmapString call to also
       provide status of the current transformation mode.  Explore how
       different combinations change the shape of the cube and the
       object coordinate frame.

  <li> Written questions: Your written answers should be submitted as
       ASCII, pdf, or high quality jpg file (i.e., a scan or a photo
       of legible written work).  Be sure to include your name and
       student number with your written questions.  

       <ol type=a>
       <li> Which 3D transformations commute with themselves and with each other, 
            that is, given two transformations A and B, when is AB = BA?  Consider 
            the following transformations: identity, translation,
            nonzero uniform scale, nonzero non-uniform scale, rotation, shear. 
            Build a table or grid to show your answer, filling in only the lower
            triangle and diagonal.</li>

       <li> Show that a 90 degree 2D rotation can be created by
            composing a sequence of shears. </li>
      </ol>

      </li>


  </ol>
