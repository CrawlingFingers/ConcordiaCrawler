  In this assignment you will implemnet robust collision 
  processing, similar to the cloth system in [Bridson et al. 2002]. 
  For simplicity, your implementation will be in 2D, and will in 
  many respects extend the code you worked on in assignment 1 (see
  the notes on provided code below).  In addition to creating a
  video of something interesting, you are invited to take part in 
  the "alphabet soup challenge" to see how many letters you can simulate 
  before edge-edge interpenetrations occur.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Sample Code</em></span></p>

  Download the provided code from WebCT (do not distribute).  The
  code has two main packages, similar to the previous assignment.  Note
  that the <em>tools</em> package has minor updates, so you will want to 
  make sure you use this one.  The <em>a2</em> package contains code
  which is very similar to the first assignment except for a few 
  notable differences  

  <ul style="list-style-type: square;">        
    <li> ParticleSystem.java now implements a symplectic Euler 
         step in update particles, and does not make use of the
         Integrator interface from the previous assignment.
    <li> TestSystems.java implements a variety of test systems 
         that will help you debug and stress-test your code.  Feel
         free to add your own test systems too, though note you can
         also do this on the fly using mouse clicks.
    <li> LeafSpring.java implements a joint spring between three 
         particles, which is useful for creating long 2D strings
         which hold their shape (for instnace, letters).
    <li> AlphabetSoupFactory.java is used by TestSystem to generate
         mass spring systems from fonts.
    <li> SanityCheck.java is used by the application to test for 
         edge-edge collisions, that is, a discrete collision detection
         test.  If collisions are found, the background turns red and 
         the simulation is stopped (i.e., game over).
  </ul>

  <p>You <span style="font-weight: bold;">do not need to change
     anything except RobustCCD.java</span> and optionally
     TestSystems.java if you want to hard code additional test cases
     or special scenarios.  Be sure to leave a comment in your readme.txt
     on any additional test cases you add, or other modifications 
     outside of the RobustCCD.java code.<p>

<!--  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Jars and Native Libraries</em></span></p>
-->

  <p>The setup for jars and libraries 
    is the same from the previous assignment.  Consult the 
     A1 page for more information.  Likewise, you may also 
     want to visit the previous assignment specification for
     instructions on making videos.</p>

<h2 class="section">Steps and Objectives (5/5) * 95%</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

  <p>This assignment contains two main parts.  First is the continuous
  collision detection for points and line segments.  Second is the
  response to collisions.  You will need to modify the symplectice
  Euler step in the updateParticles() method, which advances the
  system by the given time step h.  As discussed in class and
  documented in the method, this method does the following:</p>

  <ol style="list-style-type: numeric;">     
  <li> Symplectic Euler velocity update using forces from springs, gravity, etc.
  <li> Velocity-level collision response (iterative solve)
  <li> Symplectic Euler position update (guaranteed intersection free)
  </ol>

  <p>Both main parts of the assignment are concerned with step two listed
  above (i.e., the velocity-level collision resolution).</p>

  <ol>        
    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Continuous Collision Detection</em></span></p>

        <p> Perform robust interval-based collision detection of all
        particle-edge pairs during the time interval (0,h] for the
        given step size h.  The edges defined by Spring objects
        connecting particles.  As discussed in class, you will do this
        by doing the following</p>

	<ul style="list-style-type: square;">        
	  <li> Given the particles are moving on linear trajectories
          specified by their position at the current time and their
          velocity, find all times of co-linearity on (0,h] by solving
          the appropriate quadratic equation.
          <li> determine the contact location on the line segment, for
          instance, as a parameter alpha in [0,1].
	</ul>

	<p>Note that some roots will give you a situation where the
        particle is not on the line segment.  You should go through
        the roots in the interval (0,h] in ascending order, and then
        process only the earliest collision you find.</p>

        <p>Note also that your root finding needs to be robust!  You
        may need to add epsilon checks for the alpha parameter you
        compute, and it may also be beneficial to check roots that
        happen just after h (i.e., h plus some small time based
        epsilon).</p>

	<p>A quick way of testing this part is to pin the three
        particles involved in a collision each time you find a
        collision in the interval (0,h].  You should make a very short
        movie to demonstrate this objective and to show your progress.
        </p>

    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Collision Impulses</em></span></p>

        <p> When you find a collision on (0,t], you must apply an
        appropriate impulse to the particles involved to resolve the 
        collision.  As discussed in class, this involves the following.
	<ul style="list-style-type: square;">        
	  <li>Computing a suitable unit normal for the collision (at
        the time of collision),
	    <li>Computing a suitable impulse using a small
	    near-inelastic restitution coefficient (e.g., the 
            default value which is set for you in the interface).
	    <li> Updating the velocities of the particles given the
             impulse, and using the assumption that pinned particles
             have infinite mass (i.e., in computing the impulse and 
             distributing the impulse to the 3 particles).
	</ul>

	<p>You may find it useful to temporarily setting the
        restitution value to 1 (or other values using the slider)
        to help debug your velocity impulses.</p>

    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Iterative Solve</em></span></p>

        <p>Many particles and edges may be colliding in a given time
         interval.  You will want to sequentially check all
         particle-edge pairs, and immediately after each check you
         should apply the collision impulses you compute in the
         previous step.  You should continue through all the pairs
         in this manner, but note that there may still be collisions
         on the interval (0,t] after processing all pairs as some
         particles may be involved in multiple collisions.  As such
         you'll need to iterate over all pairs until you have resolved 
         all collisions on (0,t].  As discussed in class, this may be 
         slow to converge.  It is a good idea to give up after a some
         maximum number of iterations, and return false to report the
         problem and halt the simulation.
        
    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Penalty Forces</em></span></p>

        <p>Penalty forces can help keep objects separate and reduce
	  the number of difficult velocity-level impulses that need to
	  be applied.  The penalty forces will let you model edges as
	  if they had a thickness of 2H.  A default thickness of 2
	  pixels is set for you in the user interface controls.  So,
	  as discussed in class, if a particle is within a distance of
	  H of a line segment, then apply a simple spring force
	  impulse with stiffness identical to the stretch springs.
          see also [Bridson et al. 2002] for more details.</P>

         <p>For your simulation to run smoothly, you'll likely need
           to address particle-particle penalty forces, i.e., forces
           when alpha falls just outside of [0,1].</P>

    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Interesting Video</em></span></p>

        <p> Record a sequence of something interesting or amusing.
        Note that you can create particles by clicking with the mouse,
        and you can also pin and unpin particles by clicking them.
        So experiment, have fun, and make a movie of something
        creative and interesting. </p>

    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Optional: Alphabet Soup Challenge</em></span></p>

        <p>How many letters can you simulate before the soup goes bad?
        Post your successes to WebCT, and the final results will be
	also added to this page for posterity.  Note that simulation 
        parameters must be reasonable (no extra bouncy
        collisions).</P>


    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Optional: Extensions</em></span></p>

        You might optionally like to think about the following issues.

        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">        
	  <li> Frictional contact is generally a hard problem, but
	    there exist many good models for friction during impact.
	    For impacts, you may want to read about what Bridson
	    suggests as a straightforward way to apply impulses
	    opposing tangential motion.
          <li> The iterative solver can fail to converge, even after
            adding penalty forces.  You can improve robustness and
            find solutions in these difficult cases by using <em>rigid
            impact zones</em> as described in [Bridson 2002].  This
            effectively acts like a velocity filter and provides a
            "fail safe" to avoid interpenetration when the iterative
            solver fails.  There are drawbacks, however, as rigid
            zones can be large and will eliminate interesting
            deformable dynamics.
          <li>As particle numbers increase, the all particle-edge
            pair collision test becomes quite expensive.  Space time
            bounds can be used to cull many root finding tests, but you
            could also consider a "broad-phase" collision detection
            scheme, such as a uniform grid subdivision of space.
          <li>You may like to think about the complexities of moving
            this simulation to 3D.  For instance, the modifications
            would include: both particle triangle tests and edge-edge
            tests, robust solution of cubic polynomials, robustly
            testing point in triangle.  A nice aspect of [Bridson et
            al. 2002] is also the subdivision surface refinement of
            the 3D cloth, which gives very smooth results for 
	    coarse cloth simulations.
	</ul>
    
  </ol>

  Some tips for robust simulation.  Watch out for all special cases as
  they will happen once you are running large simulations.  If you are
  dividing, you can probably be sure that the denominator will be zero
  in some cases (and you should deal with these cases differently).
  Use double precision floating point.  Use epsilon checks to make
  your code robust to floating point error.  Finally, strive for
  correctness instead of speed.
