<h1>COMP 599 - Winter 2010 - Assignment 3<br>
Motion Capture Reuse</h1>
</div>


<h2 class="section">Due 23:55 pm Thursday March 11</h2>


<h2 class="section">Getting Started</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

  <p><img align="right" style="padding-left:20px;padding-bottom:20px;" src="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp599W10/a3/mocaps.png"> In this assignment, you will create an animation of a human
  figure by concatenating small clips of motion capture sequences.
  This technique for reusing motion capture is often called motion
  graphs because one can imagine the nodes as containing small
  sequences of motion and the directed graph edges specify where
  transitions can occur between clips.  Typically some computation is
  necessary to decide which transitions to take when creating a new
  motion to satisfy a goal or to follow some path; however, in this
  assignment it will be sufficient to show some random transitions
  that produce interesting motion.</p>

  <p>Download the <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp599/mocap/">motion capture
  data</a>.  You need the bhv and javabin files, but you do not need
  the c3d files.  They are provided just for reference as it is a
  standard format, and the javabin files are created from these using
  a matlab script.  Note that you might just want to download one
  sequence initially for testing (e.g., the OptiTrack-IITSEC2007 demo
  sequence from NaturalPoint is a good starting point).  Sequences
  captured in the lab will be added to this directory for everyone to
  use.  Put the data files in to a "data" folder, and please <span
  style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>do not submit
  bvh, c3d, or javabin data files when you submit your
  assignment</em></span>.</p>
  
  <p>Download the provided code from WebCT 
<!-- <a href="comp599-a3.zip">provided code</a> -->
  and dump
  it into a new java project.  The code contains two parts, just like
  the previous assignments: the tools package, and the code specific
  to assignment 3.  Note that there may have been small changes to the
  tools package (i.e., the BoxRoom class which is used to draw a floor
  and walls now lives in the comp599.tools.viewer package).  Here
  follows a short description of the provided files.

  <ul style="list-style-type: square;">        

    <li> A3App contains the main method, creates the 3D viewer, and
         defines the keyboard controls attached to the 3D canvas.
         This is the only file you need to modify, but you can also
         create other classes as you see fit (but <span
         style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>leave a
         note in the readme.txt if you modify any of the other three
         classes listed below</em></span>).</li>

    <li> C3DData loads the marker data from a javabin file.  Note that
         c3d files need to be converted to a java binary, and this has
         already been done for you with the data we captured in class
         (see the javadoc if you want to convert your own files).</li>

    <li> BVHData loads the skeleton and joint angle data from a bvh
         file.  The simple parser also creates a hierarchy of
         SkeletonNode objects.  The setSkeletonPose method sets the
         joint angles and root translation for the loaded skeleton.
         The motionData is private, but you should not need to do this
         for the objectives below.</li>

    <li> SkeletonNode defines a joint which can rotate about a set of
         axes.  The object has a parent SkeletonNode (null if it is
         the root), and a list of children).  The rotation axes of the
         skeleton node are located at a fixed offset from the parent
         frame, and the order of rotation is specified in a channel
         list (as loaded by the BVHData).  While all skeleton nodes
         joints can also have a translation component, this is only
         used for the root of the character (usually the hips).  The
         init method of this class estimates the size of different
         segments of the body to display simple 3D geometry between
         the joint and its parent.  There are a number of controls for
         displaying the skeleton in different ways.  Finally, note the
         getTransform method which gives you a transformation from the
         joint frame to the parent frame (you will want to use this to
         find the position and orientation of the root of your
         skeleton).  You may want to expand the "Skeleton pose
         controls" in the provided interface and try adjusting
         different angles to get some intuition for how these work.
         </li>

  </ul>

    <p>A few things to watch out for:</p>
    
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">

    <li>The bvh and c3d data files may not contain the same number of
    frames (it might be off by one, and the current bvh loader
    currently tries to read an extra frame).  You may want to set the
    maximum frame number to be the lower of the two frame
    counts. </li>

    <li>Watch out for Matrix4d.get( Matrix3d R ) as this does a SVD
    normalization and can permute your axes when you're not looking.
    The better option for getting the upper 3x3 component of a 4x4
    matrix is getRotationScale().  Your upper 3x3 component should
    already be unitary, but if it were not, again, you should use
    Matrix3d.normalizeCP() instead of Matrix3d.normalize() as the
    former does a cross product normalization instead of an SVD
    normalization.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Again, you do not need to change anything in the tools package to
  complete this assignment.  The source for the tools is provided only
  for your convenience, and you should <span style="font-weight: bold;
  color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>focus your attention on the a3
  package</em></span>.  It is suggested that you read through all the 
  provided code, and note in particular the areas that are marked
  TODO.</p>

  </div>

<h2 class="section">Steps and Objectives (8/10)</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

  <ol>        

    <li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Basic motion playback</em></span></p>

         <p>The provided code will try to load a data file.  Modify
         the constructor of A3App so that it uses the data file you
         selected (note that you will revisit the other TODOs in the
         constructor in later objectives).  </p>

	 <p>The display method will automatically advance the current
         frame by an amount specified by the playSpeed, but it does
         not set the pose of the skeleton.  You need to make a simple
         modification so that the skeleton pose is updated when the
         frame number changes (i.e., the setSkeletonPose method of the
         BVHData). This class also contains methods to allow you to
         save a trajectory of modified skeleton poses back out to disk
         in bvh format. See the addCurrentPoseToTrajectory() and
         save(). </p>

         <p>Note that the current code will not play the motion back
         at the correct speed, but it is good enough for this
         assignment.  The alternative would be to keep track of the
         time elapsed and set the frame according to the capture rate,
         which was 100 Hz (the range of the playSpeed parameter would
         need modification too so that it could be less than 1 to slow
         motion down).</p>

         <p>Check that the c3d data and the bvh data both play and are
         located in the same place (i.e., like virtual markers on a
         virtual skeleton).  To do this you need to click the
         <em>drawc3d</em> checkbox of the controls.</p>
       
    <li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Computation and display of the local floor frame</em></span></p>

         <p>Write a method to compute a local frame for the current
         skeleton pose.  Add code to your display call that uses this
         method and displays the frame.  The local frame should be
         located on the floor (y=0) with the y axis vertical, and the
         z axis pointing in the direction of the z axis of the hips
         (i.e., z axis of skeleton root projected onto the floor).
         See the getTransform method of SkeletonNode for getting the
         position and orientation of a skeleton node.</p>

         <p>There are two reasons why we need this local floor based
         reference frame.  First is to know where the character is and
         to allow us to properly translate and orient a motion clip
         based on what came before.  The second reason is to help us
         with making comparisons between the posture of the skeleton
         at different points in time (see the later objectives).  That
         is, putting the marker data (c3d) in coordinates of this
         frame allows two frames of marker positions to be compared
         while disregarding position in the x-z plane and rotation
         about the y axis.</p>

         <p>You will likely find it useful to use a FlatMatrix4d
         (comp599.tools.viewer) to store your frame (i.e., use the
         getBackingMatrix to get the contained Matrix4d object);
         notice the asArray method which you can use to get an array
         that is compatible with glMultMatrixd.  Note that jogl always
         has an extra parameter for any opengl call which takes an
         array to allow for indexing within the array, so in this case
         you would pass a zero as the second parameter to
         glMultMatrixd.  Reuse the existing FancyAxis (that is used in
         the display call to draw the world reference frame) to draw
         your local frame, but you will want to call setSize to make
         it an appropriate size (e.g., 25 cm high).</p>

    <li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Basic transitions</em></span></p>

	 <p>The constructor creates a frame pair and stores it in a
         list.  Modify the display call so that the frame number is
         modified to take this transition.  While both forward and
         backward jumps make sense, you'll want to first test by
         always taking the backward transition (i.e., make an endless
         loop from a small portion of motion data). </p>

         <p>Note that the frame
         number is not necessarily advancing one frame at a time
         (i.e., when playing at higher speeds) so you'll want to make
         sure you still make this transition even if you're not
         exactly at the frame.</p>

-->

    <li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Accumulated transformation</em></span></p>
         
	 <p>Now that you have some basic code to loop a smaller clip
         of motion capture data, you'll need to accumulate the
         translation and rotation of the character (for instance, to
         assemble two steps into a continuous walk).</p>

	 <p>Again, you will probably want to use a FlatMatrix4d to
	 create an accumulated transformation frame.  Initialize it to
	 the identity, and update this accumulated frame each time you
	 make a transition.  The update you need to apply is the one
	 that puts the next clip's beginning floor frame at the
	 current clip's ending floor frame (i.e., you have transforms
	 that map A to W and B to W and you need A to B).</p>

         <p>Add code to your display call so that you multiply this
         accumulated frame on the matrix stack before displaying the
         skeleton and c3d data.  Once this works, you might want to
         hand pick two similar frames in the data you've loaded to
         generate a nice walk cycle.</p>

         <p>Finally, add code to reset this accumulated frame to the
         identity when the 'R' key is pressed.  You need to have a
         convenient means of bringing your animated character back
         into the room if it goes wandering too far!</p>
         
         
    <li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Compute and display local c3d positions and
         velocities</em></span></p>

	 <p>At startup you will want to precompute local frame marker data
	 (i.e., go back to the A3App constructor and add a method call
	 to whatever code you write for the computation part of this
	 step).  Use your local floor frame code and the c3d data to
	 build phase space vectors representing the position and
	 velocity of markers in the local frame.  To compute the
	 velocities average the velocity of the marker position over a
	 small window (say 5 frames), so that the velocity estimates
	 are <em>smooth</em> (not all trajectories were filtered in the Arena
	 software before export, and there may be high frequency
	 motions of markers due to poor position estimation from 2D
	 camera data).</p>

	 <p>You will want to test that you've computed these vectors
         correctly, so add some code to the display method to multiply
         the local frame (use glPush and glPop too) onto the matrix
         stack and draw these positions and small (scaled) line
         segments to represent the velocities.  Add a BooleanParameter
         to enable and disable drawing the debugging information in
         the A3App.  Add your BooleanParameter to the control panel in
         the A3App getControls method.  You may also want to add a
         DoubleParameter to the controls to help you scale the
         visualization of the velocity vectors appropriately.</p>

	 <p>Remember that we are computing the position and velocity
         of the markers in this local frame to help with comparisons
         of movement at different parts of the motion clip.  We could
         also have used joint angles, but would need a more
         complicated weighted metric, and we would need to deal with
         the root of the skeleton differently.</p>

    <li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Find good transitions automatically</em></span></p>

	 <p>Write code to automatically find good transitions.  Again
         you'll want to add a method call from your constructor to
         initialize the pairs when you first start, but you might also
         want to add a button to the control panel or add a call on a
         key press to recompute the pairs again on the fly.  This is
         because there are several parameters and heuristics involved
         in finding good pairs, and you will want to adjust these
         parameters without restarting and reloading the data every
         time.</p>

         <p>First note that comparing all frames with all other frames
	 is expensive!  You may want to decimate the data by some
	 factor (for instance, compute similarity only between frames
	 which have frame number divisible by 5).  Also, I suggest you
	 store the similarity scores in an array so that you can
	 display the data to help with debugging.  More on this
	 momentarily, but first let us consider the distance metric.</p>

         <p>To compare two frames you'll want to have a parameter to
         set the influence of the velocity component.  That is you
         don't want to have either positions or velocities dominate
         the comparison.  Thus, a good way to compute a similarity
         score between frames a and b would be ||x_a - x_b|| + w ||v_a
         - v_b||, where x is the positions of all markers in the local
         floor frame in a single vector, v is the (smoothed)
         velocities of all markers in the local floor frame, and w
         weights the two.  If you create a double parameter for w,
         then you can add it to the controls and tune the parameter
         while you are running the program, and press a button to
         request a recomputation of pairs with the new similarity
         metric.  How do you choose a good value w?  This depends on
         the units in which quantities are measured.  </em> Report in
         your readme how you justify your choice of w</em>.</p>

         <p>Once you have the similarity between frames, you will need
         a threshold to decide which frames are close enough to permit
         a transition.  Again, it is probably a good idea to create a
         DoubleParameter and tune this online.</p>

         <p>Finally, some good threshold values may producing too many
         transitions.  I suggest you only implement some heuristics
         for adding only the best transitions in any given local area
         of the timeline.  For instance, you might go through all
         frames one by one, checking for the best match that is below
         the similarity threshold, and then only add that one best
         match to the frame pairs list.  Likewise, to prevent a
         transition at every frame, you might prevent any transitions
         from being created within some number of frames.  Add to the
         control panel whatever parameters you need for the heuristics
         you choose, and then find parameters that work for you!  </em>Be
         sure to comment on your heuristics and the parameters in your
         readme file</em>.</p>

	 <p>Finally, one last suggestion related to the similarity
         data that I suggested (above) that you store: add code (and a
         BooleanParameter to toggle display) to make a visual plot of
         this similarity data for the current frame.  This will help
         you visualize the result of your similarity metric at
         different times, and to help in selecting a threshold.  See
         the displayTimeline method (and the drawArc method) for a
         hacky example of 2D drawing, and for additional suggestions
         how to visualize the similarity data.</p>

    <li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Random and interesting transitions</em></span></p>

         <p>Add code that allow for a variety of different and
         interesting transitions.  For instance, you might want to
         randomly take transitions (either forward or backward).  You
         might also want to prevent too many transitions from occurring
         in a small time frame.  For instance, no more than 1
         transition every half second since there will be a small
         visual error in the motion at each jump (nothing matches
         perfectly, so fewer transitions per second will minimize
         this).  You might want to also identify the last frame that
         has a transition, and always jump backwards from this frame
         (and never jump forwards); this way you can avoid playing
         past the end of the loaded capture file.  Finally, if you're
         feeling ambitious, you might want to control the kinds of
         transitions that can occur, forward, backward, random, or
         none, using keyboard controls.</p>

    <li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Make two movies</em></span></p>

         <p>You must make two movies.</p>

         <p> First, make a movie with the same snapshot saving method
         used in the previous assignment to show your results.  Try to
         capture something fun, but at the very least your video
         should demonstrate a motion that involves multiple
         transitions in the motion graph (i.e., both forwards and
         backwards, in either a random or controlled sequence). Keep
         this video short and to the point.

         <p>Second, make a movie using a high quality rendering.  Save
         a sequence of poses (i.e., mocap frames) to a file, and then
         use Blender to create an animation using both direct lighting
         and ambient occlusion.  <a href="blendermovie.html">Follow
         these instructions</a> to create your movie.  This movie
         should be short and aesthetically pleasing. Note that you
         will need to do something special to account for the
         accumulated translation and orientation in sequence of poses
         that you export for rendering!</li>

         <em>OPTIONAL Extensions</em></span></p>

<p>You might optionally like to think about the following issues.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">       

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>
Transition Blending</em></span></p>

     <p> Modify your code so that you blend a small group of frames
         after making a transition (i.e., mix joint angles with alpha
         and (1-alpha) where alpha runs from 0 to 1 over several
         frames).  This should address small popping artifacts that
         are visible at transitions, i.e., this problem can be reduced
         if you blend the joint angles linearly over 5 to 10 frames.
         Of course some transitions might always be bad based on how
         forgiving you set your frame similarity threshold.  Note that
         special care is necessary to blend the root frame!</p>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>
Multiple Clips</em></span></p>

     <p>The current code only loads one motion capture clip.  Can you 
        devise a simple way of modifying the code so that you can 
        accomodate a whole selection of clips.</p>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>Foot Skate</em></span></p>

<p>Use heuristics to identify when there should be
foot ground contact and use inverse kinematics to modify the motion so
that a foot in contact with the ground stays firmly planted.  An easy
way to exaggerate the foot skate problem is to modify the lengths of
body segments (i.e., make the lower leg 25% longer, and the upper leg
25% shorter).</p>

<li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><em>Control</em></span></p>

<p> Find a suitable collection of clips and transitions, and
define heuristics to get the character to move where you want.  Note
that this is easy if you string together different motions that always
return to a rest pose, but a harder problem is to produce a smooth and
natural motion that achieves the desired trajectory or goal.  How fast can you responde to changing goals?  Can you deal with dynamic obstacles?</p>
