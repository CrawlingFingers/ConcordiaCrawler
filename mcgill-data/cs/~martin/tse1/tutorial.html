	<title>Eclipse Demo for the FEAT Study</title>
	<body>
		<H1>Introduction</H1> 

		The Eclipse Platform allows you to view the files
		comprising a system, to modify these files, and to run
		a program.  This demo will give you a quick tour of
		the functionalities you need to know to carry out this
		study.
		
		<H1>Perspectives</H1> The Eclipse graphical user
		interface (or Workbench), can be organized into
		various <I>perspectives</I>.  A Perspective is simply
		a pre-determined set of views.  For this study, you
		will only use the <I>Java Perspective</I>.  A
		perspective tool bar is on the left of the Eclipse
		Workbench.  To open the Java perspective, click on the
		top button and select <TT>Java Perspective</TT>, or,
		alternately, click on the Java perspective shortcut
		button.  You can also use the general menu: select
		<TT>Window</TT> | <TT>Open Perspective</TT>, and
		select the <TT>Java Perspective</TT>.
		
		By default, the Java perspective includes four views:
		The package explorer (on the left), the editor (in the
		middle), the outline view (on the right), and the
		tasks view (on the bottom).  If at any point your
		views get mixed up, you can come back to the default
		Java perspective by selecting the menu <TT>Window</TT>
		| <TT>Reset Perspective</TT>.  However, it is not
		recommended to do this as some short cuts which are
		preset for this study will be removed.  The package
		explorer, editor, and task views will be explained in
		detail as part of this demo.  The outline view will
		not be used in this study.  You should close the view
		by clicking on the X in the top right corner, and
		refrain from using it during the study.
		
		To open or close individual views, use the menu and select <TT>Window</TT> | <TT>Show View</TT>.
		
		To close all the editors, use the menu and select <TT>File</TT> | <TT>Close All</TT>.
		
		<H3>Tutorial</H3>
		
		<OL>
		<LI>Close the Java perspective (right-click on the
		button with the 'J' in its icon, in the left tool bar, and select <TT>close</TT>.
		<LI>Open the Java perspective (in the same tool bar,
		click on the button with the 'plus' in its icon.
		Choose <TT>Java</TT> from the menu.
		<LI>Close the Outline view.
		<LI>Close all the editors.
		<LI>Close the package explorer.
		<LI>Open the package explorer (In the workbench menu,
		select <TT>Window | Show View | Packages</TT>.  You
		might have to close the hierarchy view to reveal the
		package view).
		</OL>
	
		<H1>Package Explorer</H1>
		
		The Package Explorer contains the structure and files
		of the system you are to modify.  In this demo, we use
		the example system JHotDraw 5.3.  The top-level node
		in the package explorer is the the project:
		JHotDraw5.3.  Clicking on the plus sign expands the
		project to reveal its various components: in this case
		a single source directory.  Double-clicking on the
		source directory (or clicking on the corresponding
		plus sign) will reveal all the packages and source
		directories which constitute the system.  The package
		directories contain java files, and the other
		directories contains other source files such as icons.
		
		If you expand the <TT>CH.ifa.draw.figures
		package</TT>, a collection of Java source objects will
		appear.  There are various actions you can perform on
		Java files.  Double-click on the
		<TT>ArrowTip.java</TT> object.  The code for this file
		should appear in the editor.  You can also expand an
		object.  Expand the <TT>ArrowTip.java</TT> object.
		This will reveal the internal structure of the object,
		in this case, an import declarations node and the
		<TT>ArrowTip</TT> class.  Expand the <TT>ArrowTip</TT>
		class.  You will see the class members.  A red square
		indicates a private member, a yellow diamond a
		protected member, a blue triangle a default member,
		and a green circle a public member.  Clicking on a
		member will show the declaration of this member in the
		editor.
		
		To create a new element in the package explorer, right-click on a package a select <TT>New</TT>.
		
		<H3>Tutorial</H3>
		
		<OL>
		<LI>Show the <TT>CH.ifa.draw.applet.DrawApplet.java</TT> file in the Editor.
		<LI>Display the <TT>fDrawing</TT> field in the window.
		<LI>Create a new class <TT>Test</TT> in the package <TT>CH.ifa.draw.contrib</TT>.
		</OL>
		
		<H1>Editor</H1>
		
		The editor lets you change a file.  Modifications in a Java file are automaticaly compiled in the 
		project when a file is saved.  To save a file in the editor, type <TT>Ctrl-S</TT>, or use the <TT>File</TT> menu.  If
		file contains compilation errors, they will automatically be indicated in the editor.  Errors for which 
		a suggestion is available are indicated on the left side bar with a yellow light bulb.  
		Clicking on the light bulb will reveal a set of possible corrections.  Otherwise, the error will be
		indicated with a red X.  All errors also appear in the task view, in at the bottom of the screen.  
		Clicking on a task in the task view will show the corresponding part in the code which needs to be addressed.
		The side bar on the right of the editor contains bookmarks for the various errors.
		
		The editor also supports an auto-completion feature.  When an identifier is partially typed, typing <TT>Ctrl-Spacebar</TT>
		will attempt to complete the identifier.  <TT>Ctrl-Spacebar</TT> after a type name will attempt to enter an
		import declaration for this name.

		<OL>
		<LI>Open <TT>ArrowTip.java</TT>.  <LI>Change
		<TT>getAngle()</TT> to <TT>getAngleX()</TT>.
		<LI>Observe the different errors and bookmarks.  Click
		on the errors in the Tasks view to go to the
		corresponding location in the editor.  Use the
		bookmarks in the right side bar to navigate to the
		locations of the errors.  <LI>Make a new
		<TT>TextFigure</TT> object in the <TT>ArrowTip</TT>
		constructor to show the autocomplete.
		</OL>
				
		<H1>Search</H1>
		
		It is possible to search for the references and
		declarations to a class or class member, either from
		the package explorer, or through a search menu.  To
		start a general search, select <TT>Search</TT> from
		the menu, then click on the <TT>Java Search</TT> tab.
		The results of the search will be displayed in a view
		below the editor.  Clicking on a search result will
		display the corresponding code in the editor.
		Right-clicking on a search result will allow you to
		perform new searches, for the references or
		declarations of the search result element.
		
		It is also possible to launch a search from the
		package explorer.  Right-click on an element and
		select references or declarations, and then <TT>Workspace</TT>.  This will produce
		a list of all the elements in the workspace referring
		to the selected element.
		
		<H2>Tutorial</H2>
		
		<OL>
		<LI>Search for all <TT>Text*</TT> class declarations.
		<LI>Sort by parent name (Right-click in the search
		results view, and select <TT>Sort by | Parent Name</TT>.
		<LI>Search for references to class
		<TT>TextHolder</TT>: Right-click on
		<TT>TextHolder</TT> in the search results view, and
		select <TT>References | Workspace</TT>.
		<LI>Display a few of them in the editor.
		<LI>Obtain all the methods accessing the field
		<TT>CH.ifa.draw.figures.TextTool.fTypingTarget</TT>
