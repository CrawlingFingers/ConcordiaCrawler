<p><h3><u>Course Description</u></h3>


We will cover selected topics in Artificial Intelligence.  We will study modern techniques for computers
to make good (in some cases optimal) decisions that are applicable throughout
an enormous range of industrial, civil, medical, financial, robotic and
information systems.  We will not
attempt to cover the entire range of AI sub-areas in detail, but will survey
several key themes.


<p><h3><u>Course content</u></h3>

<ol>
<li> Introduction to AI.  Brief history.  Different agent architectures. 
<li> Search: uninformed and heuristic search, A*, local search and optimization.  
<li> Constraint satisfaction problems.
<li> Game playing and adversarial search.
<li> Knowledge representation. Logical reasoning. Propositional logic.
<li> Planning algorithms.
<li> Reasoning under uncertainty.  Bayes rule.  Belief networks.
<li> Decision making. Utility theory. Reinforcement learning. Game theory.
<li> Applications.
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;
<p><h3><u>Reference Materials</u></h3>

<ol>
<li><u>Required textbook:</u> S. Russell and P. Norvig.  <i>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern
Approach</i>, <i>Third Edition</i>, Prentice Hall, 2009. Available at the McGill bookstore.
<li>
<u>Lecture notes:</u> available from the course web page.
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;
<p><h3><u>Prerequisites</u></h3>

Courses: (COMP 206 or ECSE 321) and COMP 251.<br> In some cases, students may take COMP-251 concurrently with COMP-424 (subject to instructor's permisson).
<br>
Basic knowledge of a programming language is required. Basic knowledge of probabilities/statistics, calculus and linear algebra is strongly recommended.


<p><h3><u>Class Requirements</u></h3>

The class grade will be based on the following components:
<ul>
<li>Individual quizzes in class (best 5 out of 8) - 5%
<li>Individual assignments (best 4 out of 5) - 20%
<li>Individual project (one) - 20%
<li>In-class midterm examination (one) - 15%
<li>Final examination (one) - 40%.
</ul>

<p>The weekly quizzes will be short tests designed to assess basic understanding of the course material as we progress through the topics.</p>

<p>The assignments will require primarily written work and some programming to gain hands-on experience with the concepts covered in the lectures.

<p>The project will be composed of a programming part and a
written report.  In the programming part, you will implement a
game-playing program that will play against your colleagues' programs
over the network. You will be provided with a complete program for a player that
chooses moves legally but randomly.  Your mission will be to enhance
the player, using AI techniques of your choice.  The project code will be written in Java. 
The ability to program in Java under the UNIX operating system is assumed but the use of this language is not mandatory.  You may use any programming language, as long as you can
 demonstrate that your implementation is correct. In the report, you
will describe your approach, and justify your choice of algorithms.

<p>Both the midterm and the final examination are written
examinations.  The midterm will be held during class hours. No make-up midterm will be given. The final will be held during the regular exam period.

<p><h3><u>Grading Policy</u></h3>

Assignments and projects must be submitted on myCourses by 11:59pm on the day when they are due. Submission procedure for quizzes will be explained in class. <b>Late quizzes and assignments will NOT be accepted (NO EXCEPTIONS - Please do not email asking for this.).</b> However only the marks from the 5 best quizzes and the 4 best assignments will be counted towards the final grade. <b>Late submissions for the final project (code and report) will be subject to a 10% penalty, up to 5 days only</b>; after this late submissions will not be accepted.
<p>
<b><u>All assignments are INDIVIDUAL!</u></b>
<p>
McGill University values academic integrity.  Therefore all students must understand
the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences
under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see
www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/<http://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/> ) for
more information).
<p>
Any work submitted in this course (including code, report, homeworks) may be checked using automated software to detect possible cases of cheating or plagiarism.
<p>
In accord with McGill University's Charter of Students' Rights, students in this
course have the right to submit in English or in French any written work that is to
be graded.
<p>
In the event of extraordinary circumstances beyond the University's control, the content and/or evaluation scheme in this course is subject to change.
