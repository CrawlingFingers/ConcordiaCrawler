<h2>McXML: A native XML Data Management System <br>
</h2>
McXML is a&nbsp; native XML database system with a focus on supporting
updates and transaction management:<br>
<br>
<h4>Query Execution: </h4>
McXML has as main logical data model a tree based main-memory structure
that provides the DOM interface. Hence, any XQuery execution engine
based on DOM can be plugged into McXML. Furthermore, McXML has its own
query execution engine. This engine supports as a subset of the
XQuery langauge and a set of XQuery update statements that were
proposed as an extension to XQuery.&nbsp; The current execution engine
uses standard DOM
navigation with some extra index structures. McXML provides full transaction
management and concurrency control . <br>
<br>
<h4>Storage Manager:</h4>
McXML has a page-based
storage manager. XML documents are split into subtrees which are stored
in records&nbsp; placed on fixed-width pages. Pages are the basic unit
for transfer between disk and main memory.&nbsp; Loading is done in a
lazily, i.e., records are only loaded into memory and the corresponding
subtree (DOM model) extracted when a query might need to access this
part of the
tree. When updates change the logical tree model, only the changed
parts of the tree are written back to disk. That is, only the pages
with records that contain chainged subtrees are written back to disk. <br>
<br>
<h4>Transaction Manager: </h4>
McXML has a full-fledged transaction management in place. Several
queries can be bundled to a transaction. All changes performed by a
transaction are written back to disk at commit time. If a transaction
aborts,
its changes are automatically undone. McXML offers two snapshot based
concurrency control methods, one providing optimistic concurrency
control, the other a multi-version concurrency control providing
snapshot isolation. Additionally, a hierarchical locking scheme is
implemented. <br>
