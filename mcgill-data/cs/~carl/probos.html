<P> Here are the programming assignments as promised. 
You will hand in assignments via a hand-in facility. For a description of how to use it see <a href="http://socsinfo.cs.mcgill.ca" /wiki.handin>http://wocsinfo.cs.mcgill.ca/wiki.Handin</a>
You can make use of the labs in Trottier in doing these assignments.  These machines support Ubuntu Linux 
version 10). 
<P>Please note that there will be a series of tutorials on Linux. You can find a schedule of when and
where they
are to be given at <a href="http://socsinfo.cs.mcgill.ca/wiki/Unix_Seminars">http://socsinfo.cs.mcgill.ca/wiki/Unix_Seminars></a> 
<P>There are some good C tutuorials on the web which you might wish to avail yourself of. Here are a couple:

<P> The assignments for this course are <B>individual</B>. Talk
to your colleagues, but don't hand in the same project(s). My 
policy for copying is simple: all of the parties get a zero on
the assignment, and I don't want to hear any stories. 
Same policy if the solution comes via a third  party on the web.
<P> The lateness policy for projects is simple. The projects must
be on time; no excuses (documented medical excuses are an exception). You get a zero if they are late. So, turn
in your code in whatever state it happens to be by the deadline.
It will be read through and graded. Just because a semi-colon is missing
does not mean that you get a bad grade. 
<P> And now a word from our institution. 
"McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore, all
students must understand the meaning and consequences of
cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences under the Code
of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see
