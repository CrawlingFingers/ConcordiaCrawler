As you can guess from the title of the assignment, you are going to
implement the Barnes-Hutt algorithm. The emphasis will be on load
balancing, since oct-trees are not very good at knowing where the bodies
are located. You should use the BSP (Bulk Synchronous Programming) model
to implement the  algorithm. 
<p>In BSP all of the 
processors do the following:
<br>
<ul>
<li>compute</li>
<li>barrier</li>
<li>synchronize</li>
<li>barrier</li>
<li>repeat</li>
</ul>
<br>
This approach is easy to implement and the serial code will not wind up
looking all that different from the parallel code. The implementation
should be on a shared memory machine.
<p>
Now to the fun part-load balancing. You can implement one of two load
balancing algorithms (1) orthogonal recursive bisection (2) cost-zones.
The first scheme is the easier of the two, and only works in 2-D. The
second scheme will take more work to implement. You should use shared
memory for this load balancing algorithm, as it will be much easier to
implement this way. 
<p>
The choice is yours-if you feel adventurous and have the time, try 2.
However it is not required (you will clearly get extra consideration for
implementing the second method). There will be no loss of marks if you
chose 1. 
<p>
You should use 4 to 6 processors . Assume that the particles all have
the same mass (say 1). You should present results for several (at least
3) different initial configurations, i.e. different load distributions
in which you show the results for all of the processors. You should run
the algorithm without load balancing for one of the initial
configurations in order to show the improvements produced by the
algorithm.

<h2>The assignment</h2>
Your assignment should be submitted in two parts:
<ul>
<li>
A tar file containing a separate directory for each of your
programs. Each directory should contain your source code and a
Makefile.
</li>
<li>Your writeup about the programs. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>Email me a message with a text attachment containing the program and a
second attachment containing your writeup (in either Word or pdf
format). 
<h2>Grading Criteria</h2>
<ul>
<li>
10% Program correctness. 
</li>
<li>
40% Program clarity, elegance and parallelization. The programs should
be well-documented internally with comments.
</li>
<li>
10% Program scalability and performance.
</li>
<li>
40% Writeup. Your grade on the writeup includes the quality of the
writing, whether all of
the required elements are included, and the clarity of your
explanations.
