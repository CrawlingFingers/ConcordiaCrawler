<h1 align="center">Problem 3-Simulation of an RR Scheduler</h1>
</font>

In this exercise, you will write a discrete event simulator which you will use to analyze the RR scheduling mechanism. First
a bit of background on discrete-event simulation, followed by a description of the problem itself. 
<p>
Computer simulations are programs which are used to model the behavior of a real system and predict its behavior by
examining the behavior of the model instead of the system itself. These programs are widely used  to determine the
behavior of man-made systems (aircraft, computer systems and networks) before they are built. They are also used to
examine the behavior of natural systems such as the human brain and planetary motion. 
<P>
A simulation program is comprised of a set of modules, each of which is meant to model part of the system which we are
studying (the target system). 
For example, one module might represent a the enqueuer portion of a scheduler, another the ready list, another the
dispatcher. The enqueuer module places the jobs in the ready list module, the dispatcher module retrieves simulated jobs from the 
simulated ready list, etc. 
Each simulation module is constructed as a simulation procedure, i.e. one or more programming
language functions (think C or C++). 
<P>
As an example, consider the behavior of an airport reservation agent (they might be machines now) who are supposed to
help passengers with their reservations, and ask them if they are terrorists. When a passenger enters the airport he goes to the back
of a line to wait for help from the agent, waits his turn and is served by the agent, after which he goes on his way. The
airlines might be interested in determining the average waiting time and the maximum waiting time for a customer, given a
particular arrival pattern by the passengers. To answer these questions, we can construct a model of the system and
simulate it.  
<P>
In a discrete-event model, the entities of interest (agents, passengers in the example)  are represented by data structures. The 
state of the system is represented by values assigned to these data structures. In a discrete event system, the state of
the system changes at discrete instants in time (as opposed to continuous simulations). In the airport model, if we assume
that the simulation starts with all of the agents idle, then the first transition occurs when the first passenger arrives
to be served. The events in the simulation would be:
<ul>
<li>Event 1 (Passenger arrival) Causes the simulator to run a function which creates a new instance of the passenger data structure
and puts the instance into a data structure which represents the line of waiting passengers. Fields in the passenger data
structure should identify the passenger, save the time of the passenger arrival, save the time at which the passenger
begins service, and save the time at which the passenger leaves. These entities enable us to determine the waiting time of
the customers. After the passenger arrives, the function should place him on a line. The function should check to see if there 
are idle agents; if so, the agent should be paired with the passenger. This time at which the next passenger arrives can
also be scheduled. 
<li>Event 2(Customer departure) When a passenger begins service, the corresponding fucntion determines the time at which the
service completes, and adjusts the data strutures to reflect this, and schedules the next event #2. If there are no
passengers waiting, then the agent waits. This function can determine the amount of time that the agent is busy and is
waiting. 
</ul>
<P>
In general, a simulation program is comprised of a simulation application and simulation kernel. The application part is
specific to the model, e.g. the airport model or a model of the RR scheduling algorithm. The kernel's job is to manage
simulated time, calling the functions associated with the events at the right times. An outline of the simulation kernel
follows.
<br>
simulated-time==0;<br>
while(true) {<br>
event=select-next-event();<br>
if (event->time>simulated_time)<br>
simulated_time=event->time;<br>
evaluate(event->function,....);<br>
}
<P>
You will need to implement a simulation kernel and the simulation application for this exercise. 
Here is an outline for the kernel.
<br>
void runKernel(in quitTime)<br>
{<br>
Event *thisEvent;<br>
if (wuitTime <=) quitTime=99999999;<br>
simTime==0;<br>
while(simTime < quitTime) {<br>
if(eventList= =NIL {<br>
thisEvent ==eventList;<br>
eventList=thisEvent->next;<br>
simTime=thisEvent->getTime( );<br>
thisEvent->fire();<br>
delete(thisEvent);<br>
};<br>
}
<P>
You will need a data structure to keep the events in time-stamped order. A priority queue (heap) ordered by the time of 
each event is a standard approach. 
<P>
Now for the simulation application. Design it so that each procedure implements data structures that you need (e.g. the
system's ready list) or procedures to change the simulations's state(creating a new job, entering the job into the ready
list, dispatching a job, simulating an interrupt, etc). First define the modules that you will need in the program, and
then encode them as procedures. 
<P>
Finally, you should instrument your simulation appliction to collect the necessary information you will need to measure
the performance of the system. You will need to compare the performance of the system with different context switching
times and time-slice values. 
<P>
Create an input file with entries having the form (job ID, job arrival time, job service time). Run the simulations for
dispatcher overhead times to be 0,5,10,15,20,25 msec. and time quanta of 50,100,250 and 500 msec. 
Run the simulation a number of times to gather the information and use a graphing package to plot the performance. You can 
decide on what the package should portray.
