Course Description</B>:
<P>
In attempting  to explain the natural wold, it is standard practice for a
scientist
to develop  a theory and to then subject this theory to experimental 
verification. Similarly, engineers build prototypes to investigate their
designs. This paradigm is becoming increasingly difficult to pursue
because of
the sheer size and complexity of the systems which we are trying to 
design and the phenomena which we are trying to understand. Trying to 
subject theories on the evolution of the galaxy or climate change to 
experimental verification or building a new aircraft on the basis of a
paper
design are not realistic approaches.  This traditional approach 
is largely being replaced by a new paradigm, a computational science
approach in which high performance computer systems are used
to simulate the phenomena which we wish to either explain and the
systems which we wish to design.  Examples of this  approach in science
include
global climate modeling, computational chemistry and brain modeling.
Familiar examples in engineering include computational fluid dynamics
for aircraft design, semiconductor design and nuclear weapons design. 
In the business world, economic forecasting models drive both 
business decisions and stock trading programs.

One inescapable conclusion is that the computing platforms on
which we implement these numerical models (or simulations) must
be powerful.  They are also parallel machines. The reason that they
are parallel is that there are limitations to the number of transistors
which can be packed onto a chip and we are rapidly approaching this
limit, in spite of all of the efforts made by VLSI designers. Moore's
law ( enunciated in 1965)  predicted that the number of transistors
which
could be etched on a chip would double once every 18 months. In 1975
that meant about 4,000. In 2006 it means about a billion!! In that time
period 
the clock rate of a microprocessor went from about 1 MHz to 1 GHz. 
This came at a cost, however. Moore's second law saw in increase
in the cost of a semi-conductor foundry go from about  $10,000,000
to $10,000,000,000 (constant 1995 dollars).  There is an inevitable
consequence, which is physical. There is a limit to how far a transistor

can shrink. At present, they are not the size of atoms, which will be
necessary
in order to continue this growth. In short, the future is parallel- for
those of
little faith, you need look no further then the  January, 2006
announcement by Apple that the iMac and the MacBook Pro are now dual
core machines.

<p><B>Syllabus</B>
<br>
The focus of this course is on parallel programming. There will be an
emphasis on the use of clusters because they are there-by this I mean
that they are cheap and can be built from off the shelf CPU's and
networks. 
<P>
Here is an outline of the topics which we are going to cover. 
<ul>
<li>Parallel machine and programming models-shared memory, distributed
shared
memory, message passing

<li>Programming techniques-partitioning, pipelined computations, synchronous
computations, load balancing and termination detection

<li>Algorithms and applications-linear algebra, partial differential
equations,
particle methods.
</ul>
<br>
These topics are subject to time limitations and the instructor's whims
......
<P><B>
How the course will be run</B>:

I am going to cover material from the course text and other places in 
the form of lectures. You will build parallel programs based on the
material which we cover in the course. This is a seriously hands on
course. You have the option of replacing one of the assignments
which I give you with a project of your very own. It can be from your
research. Needless to say, I have to be happy with it. 
I will expect a detailed description of the algorithms which
you chose to implement, a detailed description of related algorithms,
a detailed description of the application which you chose along
with your motivation for chosing the problem.
