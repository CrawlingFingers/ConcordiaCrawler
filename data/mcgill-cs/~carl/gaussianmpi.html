<BR>
<P><B>Gaussian Elimination Using MPI
</B>:


	In this assignment, you will use what you learned about parallelizing
Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting to develop a scalable
message passing implementation using MPI. 
You should write your program in C+MPI. 
You may want to use some of the MPI
collective communication primitives in your program.
<p> 
Use problem size 6000 x 6000 to evaluate the performance of your 
implementation. 
You should randomly generate
the input matrix <code>a</code> and solution vector <code>b</code>.
<p>
 Your program should
measure the elapsed time of your solver, which includes
the elimination and back solve phases, 
but not the matrix initialization or answer verification. 
<p>
Write a document that describes how your program works. 
This document should <em>not</em> include your
programs, though it may include figures containing pseudo-code that
sketch the key elements of your parallelization strategy for each
implementation. Explain how
your program partitions the data, work, and exploits parallelism. 
If your program uses collective communication, explain how; if not,
explain why not.
Your writeup should include a table with timing
measurements for your solver on
the processors which you use. 
Plot the <b>parallel efficiency</b>
 of your program executions. 
The x axis should show the number of processors. The Y
axis should show your measured parallel efficiency for the execution.
</li> </ul> 

<h2>Submitting your Assignment</h2>
Your assignment should be submitted in two parts.
<ul>
<li>A tar file containing a separate directory for each of your
programs. Each directory should contain your source code and a
Makefile.
</li>
<li>Your writeup about the programs. 
</li>
</ul>
Email me a message with a text attachment containing the program and a
second attachment containing your writeup (in either Word or pdf
format). The program is due on Tuesday, April 3 at midnight. 
<h2>Grading Criteria</h2>
<ul>
<li>
10% Program correctness. 
</li>
<li>
40% Program clarity, elegance and parallelization. The programs should
be well-documented internally with comments.
</li>
<li>
10% Program scalability and performance.
</li>
<li>
40% Writeup. Your grade on the writeup includes the quality of the
writing, whether all of
the required elements are included, and the clarity of your
explanations. 
</li>
</ul>
