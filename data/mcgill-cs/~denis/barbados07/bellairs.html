<h2> Getting to Bellairs </h2>

<ol type="A">
<li> From the Airport

   <ol>
   <li> To get to Bellairs from the airport, either take a taxi (about 
        $60 Bds) and split the cost if you share) or a bus ($2 Bds). 
        If the taxi driver does not know where Bellairs is, say it is 
        located in between <b> Folkstone Park </b> and <b> Coral Reef 
Club</b>

        on the North side of Holetown. These two landmarks 
        are famous; but with all the workshops 
        during the past 15 years, Bellairs is also becoming famous 
        among taxi drivers. If you want to take a bus, there are 
        some direct busses but more interesting is to go to Bridgetown 
        first and change to another bus (at another bus station).

   </ol>
<li> At Bellairs (consult the <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~denis/barbados07/facilitymap.ps">Bellairs Map</a>)
   <ol>
   <li> When you arrive at Bellairs just go straight to the 
        <i>dining hall</i>. 
        There, you will find either people or a message for you on the 
        bulletin board or the blackboard telling you which is your room. 
Our 
        rooms are in the two buildings shaded in dark grey called 
        <i>East Wing</i> and <i>West Wing</i>. The rooms are labeled with
        <i>E</i> and <i>W</i> accordingly. You will find a key to your 
room, 
        in your room, which should be unlocked unless your roommate has 
        already arrived. In this case, you should look for your roommate 
        on the beach.

<h2> The Most Important House Rules </h2>

<ol type="A"> 
<li> Kitchen and Food

    <ol>

    <li> Breakfast is provided by Bellairs and is included in the room 
rate.
         The breakfast food is kept in the kitchen fridge. This food is
         to be used only at breakfast and finished by 9:30 a.m.
    <li> We are responsible for washing all of our dishes after breakfast.
         Please leave the kitchen clean.

    <li> We can make coffee in the kitchen any time we want.

    <li> There is a guest fridge in the dining hall where we can keep our 
own
         private food. Please label your food and remove any left over 
when 
         you depart.
 
    </ol>

<li> Showers and Sand

    <ol>
    <li> Sand in the shower drains can cause <b> enormous </b> blockage 
         problems. Please be sure to rinse off the sand from your feet 
         before entering your rooms. There are water taps outside both 
blocks
         of rooms for this purpose.
    </ol>

<li> Locked Doors and Valuables
    <ol>
    <li>  Please leave your room locked when you are not in it.
   
    <li> You can leave your money and other valuables in the safe in the 
         main office. If you leave some money in your room I suggest you
         put it in a purse inside a locked suitcase inside a closed 
closet;
         certainly do not leave it within arm's reach of the back windows
         facing the public park. This was fine ten years ago but Barbados
         has undergone a lot of <i> progress</i> in recent years.
    </ol> 
<li> Telephone
    <ol>

    Telephones and computers are available in the main office (sort of).

<h2> Bellairs Survival Hints </h2>

<ol type="A">
<li> Food and Snacks
   <ol>

   <li> We will have a cook and the food is great but if you need 
        anything special please bring it along. There will be a fridge 
        where we can keep our  private  food items.
   <li> The coffee there is of the instant variety. If you wish to 
        bring your own coffee you may do so.
   <li> Vegitarians may want to bring their favorite non-perishables, 
however
        it is not necessary since there is already a diverse selection at 
the
        local supermarket. There is also good vegetarian roti in several 
        places near Bellairs.
   </ol>
<li> Beach, Sun, Snorkeling, and SCUBA diving

   <ol>
   <li> Bellairs is situated on one of the best beaches in Barbados, so 
        don't forget your bathing suit (and skin protection) for swims 
        before breakfast and in between work sessions.
   <li> There is also good snorkeling right in front of Bellairs so if you 
        have a mask and fins bring them along too. In fact, if you SCUBA 
        dive bring your gear. There is diving right there as well and air 
        tanks at Bellairs cost only US$8.00 per tank!
   </ol>


<li> Mosquitos
    <ol>
    <li> Depending on the weather conditions and other factors, we may 
         get some mosquitoes. You should bring some bug repellant just in 
case.

    </ol>
<li> Snorers
    <ol>
    <li> We will be living in intimate quarters. All of us will share a 
         room with one or possibly (but very unlikely) two others (even 
         four to a room has occurred in the past) with a resulting 
         distance of inches between beds. If you snore let me know 
         <b>in advance</b> and I will put all the snorers together. It is 
         my experience that a snorer has no problem sleeping with another 
         snorer. In fact they enjoy it!
