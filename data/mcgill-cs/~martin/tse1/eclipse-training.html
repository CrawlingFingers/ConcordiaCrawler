	In this part of the study, you will familiarize yourself with

	environment in which you will perform the task required for
	this study.  Please read on even if you are an experienced
	Eclipse user.

	<LI>You have 30 minutes to complete this step.  You can ask
	any questions to the investigator.
	<LI>To familiarize yourself with Eclipse, follow the
	instructions in the <a href="tutorial.html">Eclipse Tutorial</A> (also
	available as a link through the study documentation table of
	contents).  If you are an experienced Eclipse user, at least
	breeze through the tutorial to make sure you know all the
	features described.
	<LI>If you finish before the 30 minutes are over, you can use
	the extra time to familiarize yourself with Eclipse and ask
	questions.  If you feel this is not necessary, just notify the
	investigator that you are ready to move to the next step of
	the study.
	<LI>Before moving on to the next step of the study, the
	investigator will ask you a series of questions to ensure you
	understand the basic concepts of Eclipse necessary to carry
