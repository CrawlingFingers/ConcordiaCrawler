	<title>Change Plan</title>
	<body>
	
	We ask you to make a change to the code of JEdit.  JEdit is a
	programmer's text editor developed in Java.  It allows users
	to open, modify, and save text files.  In this part of the
	study, you will first familiarize yourself with JEdit and one
	of its feature: <I>autosave</I>.  You will then be asked to
	prepare a change to the autosave feature.

	<H2>JEdit</H2>

	<OL>
	<LI>Launch JEdit to check it out.  From the Eclipse Run
	configurations menu, choose <TT>jEdit-4-1-pre6</TT>.  You see
	JEdit appear.  Some warning messages will be displayed in the 
	console.  This is normal.  Do not close JEdit.
	<LI>In JEdit, an opened text file is called a <I>Buffer</I>.
	The following is an extract from the JEdit Manual (section 2.1):
	<P>
	Several files can be opened and edited at once.  Each open
	file is referred to as a <I>buffer</I>.  The combo box above
	the text area selects the buffer to edit.  Different emblems
	are displayed next to buffer names in the list, depending on
	the buffer's state; a red disk is shown for buffers with
	unsaved changes, a lock is shown for read-only buffers, and a
	spark is shown for new buffers which don't yet exist on disk.
	<P>
	<LI>JEdit has an <I>autosave</I> feature.  The following is an
	extract from the JEdit Manual (section 3.3.1):
	<P>
	"The autosave feature protects your work from computer crashes
	and such.  Every 30 seconds, all buffers with unsaved changes
	are written out to their respective file names, enclosed in
	hash ("#") characters.  For example, <TT>program.c</TT> will
	be autosaved to <TT>#program.c#</TT>."  

	<P>JEdit will also
	generate <I>backup</I> files, which are terminated with a
	tilde (~) character.  These have nothing to do with your task
	in this study.  You can completely ignore them.
	<P>
	Saving a buffer using one of the commands in the previous
	section automatically deleted the autosave file, so they will
	only ever be visible in the unlikely event of a JEdit (or
	operating system) crash.
	<P>
	If an autosave file is found while a buffer is being loaded,
	jEdit will offer to recover the autosaved data.
	<P>
	The autosave feature can be configured in the <STRONG>Loading
	and Saving</STRONG> pane of tthe <STRONG>Utilities&gt;Global
	Options</STRONG> dialog box;<P>
	<LI>In JEdit, set the autosave frequency to 5 seconds.
	<LI>Open the file <TT>C:\temp\Test.txt</TT>
	<LI>Add a character to the file and do not save the file.
	<LI>Look in <TT>C:\temp</TT>.  You should see the autosave
	file.
	<LI>Save the test buffer in JEdit.  The autosave file should
	disappear.
	<LI>Add a character to the test buffer and do not save it.
	Wait 5 seconds.
	<LI>Kill JEdit using the terminate button on the Eclipse
	console (the button with the red square).
	<LI>Launch jEdit again. JEdit will attempt to recover the
	autosave file.  Click yes.  <STRONG>ATTENTION:</STRONG> A bug
	in the code of JEdit will cause the program to hang if you do
	not click <TT>yes</TT> or <TT>no</TT> in the recovery dialog
	before the time in the autosave frequency.  To avoid this,
	just click yes or no before the 5 seconds (or whatever) of the
	autosave frequency are over.  If the program hangs, you can
	kill it using the terminate button on the console.  You do not
	have to worry about this bug for the study.  Your modification
	will pass the test cases even in the presence of this bug.</OL>

	From a user perspective, that's all there is to the autosave
	feature.  You can close JEdit now.

	<H2>Change Request</H2>

	You will need to implement the following change to jEdit:
	<P>
	Modify the application so that the users can explicitly
	disable the autosave feature.  The modified version should
	meet the following requirements:

	<OL>
	<LI>jEdit shall have a checkbox labeled "Enable Autosave" above the autosave frequency
	field in the Loading and Saving pane of the global options.
	This checkbox shall control whether the autosave feature is
	enabled or not.
	<LI>The state of the autosave feature should persist between
	different executions of the tool.

	<LI>When the autosave feature is disabled, all autosave backup
	files for existing buffers shall be immediately deleted from
	disk.
	<LI>When the autosave feature is enabled, all dirty buffers should be saved within
	the specified autosave frequency.

	<LI>When the autosave feature is disabled, the tool should
	never attempt to recover from an autosave backup, if for some
	reason an autosave backup is present.  In this case the
	autosave backup should be left as is. 
	</OL>

	<H2>Expert Knowledge</H2>

	You are given the following expert knowledge about the source
	code:

	A checkbox should be added to <TT>org.gjt.jedit.options.LoadSaveOptionPane</TT>
	to enable/disable the autosave.  The autosave timer is in 
	<TT>org.gjt.sp.jedit.Autosave</TT>.
	
	<H2>Test Cases</H2>

	To determine whether or not you have successfully implemented
	the change, we will perform the following tests:
	
	<OL>
	
	<LI><STRONG>With autosave enabled, modify a buffer.</STRONG>
	The buffer should be autosaved within the specified time.

	<LI><STRONG>Save the buffer.</STRONG>  The autosave file
	should be deleted.

	<LI><STRONG>Modify the buffer.</STRONG>  The buffer should be
	autosaved within the specified time.  <STRONG>Disable the
	autosave feature.</STRONG>  The autosave file should be
	deleted.

	<LI><STRONG>Enable the autosave feature.</STRONG> The buffer
	should be autosaved within the specified time.

	<LI><STRONG>Disable the autosave feature.</STRONG> The
	autosave file should be deleted. <STRONG>Modify the buffer.</STRONG>  No
	autosave file should appear.

	<LI><STRONG>Enable autosave.  Close JEdit.  Launch JEdit.</STRONG>  Autosave
	should be enabled.

	<LI><STRONG>Disable autosave.  Close JEdit.  Copy and rename the test
	file so it looks like an autosave file.  Launch JEdit.</STRONG>  No
	recovery should be attempted.  Autosave should be disabled.

	<LI><STRONG>Enable autosave.  Close JEdit.  Copy and rename
	the test file so it looks like an autosave file.  Launch
	JEdit.</STRONG> Recovery should be attempted.  <STRONG>Select
	YES within 5 seconds.</STRONG>
	</OL>

	<H2>Task</H2>

	<OL>
	<LI>You must now investigate the code related to the change
	you must make.  You can takes notes about the code to change,
	or other aspects you deem useful.  These notes should be 
	stored in the file <TT>Notes.txt</TT> in the JEdit
	project.  

	<LI>You must make <STRONG>no change</STRONG> to the source
	code.  You are not allowed to perform temporary changes, or
	try out different alternatives.  
	<LI>Do not use the debugger.
	<LI>You have one hour to investigate the code.  Use this time
	to learn as much as possible about the code you must change.
	You will need to rely on this knowledge to perform the change 
	in the required time.
	<LI>If you are ready to go, please notify the investigator.
	</OL>
