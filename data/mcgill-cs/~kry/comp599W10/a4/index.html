<h1>COMP 599 - Winter 2010 - Assignment 4<br>Fluid Simulation</h1>
</div>



<h2 class="section">Due 23:39 pm Thursday March 25</h2>

<h2 class="section">Getting Started</h2>

  <div class="sbody">

  <p><img align="right" style="padding-left:20px;padding-bottom:20px;" src="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp599W10/a4/fluidsim.gif"> In this assignment you will implement a simple
  yet stable Eularian fluid simulation, similar to the approach
  described
  in <a href="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf">[Stam
  et al. 2003]</a>.  You should read this link before starting the
  assignment, and use it as a reference in completing the requirements
  below.  

 
  </p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Sample Code</em></span></p>

  Download the provided code from WebCT (do not distribute).  The
  code has two main packages, similar to the previous assignment.  Note
  that the <em>tools</em> package has minor updates, so you will want to 
  make sure you use this one.  The <em>a4</em> package contains code
  to provide a mouse interface and drawing interface to your fluid 
  simulation code.

  <ul style="list-style-type: square;">        
    <li> A4App.java contains the mouse interface and drawing code.
         Left click creates a source, while right click will delete
         it.  Sources can be dragged using the left button, while
         dragging while holding the right button will apply forces to
         your fluid simulation.  The mouse wheel, while hovering over
         a source, can be used to adjust the heating/cooling rate of a
         source.  Clicking with the middle button will create a
         horizontal filament.  There are keyboard controls similar to
         previous assignments (space to toggle the simulation, R to
         reset, S to step, enter to record, C to create filaments);
         see the code for full details, and feel free to adjust the
         interface to suit your needs.

    <li> Filament.java contains simple code for creating, advecting, and refining 
         thin filaments.  This is provided purely as an additional visual
         aid in determining if your fluid is behaving correctly.

    <li> Source.java contains code representing a heating or cooling source.
         A list of sources is maintained by the fluid, and is editable using
         the mouse with the code in A4App.java.

    <li> Fluid.java contains the fluid simulation framework.  This should
         be the only place where you need to add code.
  </ul>

  <p>You <span style="font-weight: bold;">do not need to change
     anything except Fluid.java</span>. However, you are free to edit
     everything as you please, and you are certainly encouraged to
     explore and understand the rest of the provided code as it is
     small in size.  Be sure to leave a comment in your readme.txt on
     any additional test cases you add, or other modifications outside
     of the Fluid.java code.<p>

<!--  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Jars and Native Libraries</em></span></p>
-->

  <p>The setup for jars and libraries 
    is the same from the previous assignments.  Consult the 
     A1 page for more information.  Likewise, you may also 
     want to visit the previous assignment specification for
     instructions on making videos.</p>

  </div>

<h2 class="section">Steps and Objectives (7/7) * 100%</h2>

  <div class="sbody">
    You will find that there is already a fair bit of provided code in
    the Fluid class.  There are forces applied to the velocity field
    when mouse dragging while right button is held.  With the velocity
    field visualization turned on you can implement and test many
    parts of the assignment.  Implementing in this case will often
    mean taking code directly from the GDC03 code examples.  Note that
    in your final step method, there are three main components: apply
    forces, update velocities, update scalar fields (temperature,
    density, etc.).  Most steps should be trivial to implement and you
    should be able to test each using the functionality of the
    provided code.</p>

  <ol>        
    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Diffusion</em></span></p>

        <p>Implement stable diffusion as per GDC03.  Test it on the
           velocity field.  Use the DoubleParameters in the Fluid code
           to select the diffusion rate and the number of iterations 
           to use with the Gauss Seidel method.</p>

    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Transport</em></span></p>

        <p>Implement a method to advect quantities in a scalar field
         based on a velocity field.  You can follow the advect code
         example in GDC03, but you should probably use 
         the <i>traceParticle</i> (already provided) to find what goes
         where.  Note that you might want to change traceParticle be
         higher order or adaptive (see also [Stam 1999]).

    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Scalar Step</em></span></p>

        <p>Implement a method to do the scalar step which will diffuse
         and advect scalar quantities in the temperature field.  Note
         that you'll also want to apply the heating / cooling effects
         of different sources to test your method.  Recall that you
         want to left click and then use the mouse wheel to create
         some sources for your test.
        
    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Poisson Solve</em></span></p>

        <p>Implement a method to do fix the velocity field so that it
         is divergence free.  Use a Gauss Seidel solve as per GDC03,
         and use the DoubleParameter in the diffusion step.  Note that
         as an extension you may want to consider a better solver
         (e.g., Conjugate Gradients).

    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Velocity Step</em></span></p>

        <p>Implement a method to do the velocity update step as per GDC03.
	  This will involves diffusion, transport, and a Poisson projection step.
           
    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Buoyancy Forces</em></span></p>

        <p>Use the temperature scalar field to compute buoyancy forces
         to apply to the scalar field.  Use the buoyancy
         DoubleParameter to scale the response.  Thus, the velocity
         update (vertical direction only) is buoyancy times step size
         times temperature delta (comparing the temperature with the
         reference temperature).  For more details, see [Foster and
         Metaxas 1997].

    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Interesting Video</em></span></p>

        <p> Record a sequence of something interesting or amusing. </p>

    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
         <em>Optional: Extensions</em></span></p>

        <p>There are a vast number of possible extensions.  Here are
        a few you might like to think about:

        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">        
	  <li> Change the domain size, e.g., allow it to be a rectangle.
            Change the width and height of cells.  How does this change 
            the divergence and Laplacian and other computations?  Would
            it be difficult to use an arbitrary triangular grid?  

	  <li> Extend the code to work in 3D.  How would you visualize 
            the different scalar fields?

	  <li> Staggered grids.  Many people prefer to define
            velocities at cell boundaries.  This makes for a trickier
            interpolation problem while simplifying some of the other
            calculations.

          <li> Add obstacles to fluid flow using geometry.  How might
            you make these obstacles dynamic and have fluid forces
            move these objects?  What would be necessary to combine 
            this fluid code with the 2D mass spring particle systems of
            Assignment 2?

          <li> The projection step could use a number of different
            fast solvers.  Note that [Stam 1999] used FISHPAK.

          <li> Use vorticity confinement to combat numerical dissipation
             (see [Fedkiw et al. 2001]).
            
          <li> See also the extensions listed at the end of the GDC03 article.

	</ul>
