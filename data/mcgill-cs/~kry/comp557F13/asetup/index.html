getting your workspace ready to work on computer graphics and computer
animation assignments.  The lab machines already have the necessary
software installed, but if you are using your own machine then you may
need to install some software.</p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;"><em>Java
and Eclipse Software</em></span></p>

      <p>If you are not already using Sun/Oracle Java, or have an
older installation, then download and install the latest
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
Java SE JDK</a> (careful not to select the JRE). Note that
you may already have "other" Java versions installed on your
machine (for instance, Microsoft or GNU Java), but avoid using
these as they will very likely lead to problems.</p>

      <p>I also strongly recommend
using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>
as a development environment. If you need to install it, then I suggest
downloading the
      <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse IDE for Java
Developers</a> because it is slightly smaller. If you have multiple
versions of java installed, you will want to make sure that you are
using the appropriate JDK (see Window-&gt;Preferences, Java, Installed
JREs) and have the compiler compliance level is set to at least 1.6
(see Window-&gt;Preferences, Java, Compiler). 
<!--If you are familiar with Eclipse, you can probably skip the rest of this section.-->
</p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;"><em>Using
Eclipse</em></span></p>

      <p>Eclipse uses a workspace to organize your projects. When you
start eclipse for the first time, it will make you a workspace in some
default location (probably your home directory), but you can switch
workspaces with the file menu, and open any folder you want for your
workspace. One nice way to organize this would be to create a
workspaceComp557 folder in your home directory, then tell eclipse to
open that workspace.</p>

      <p>
Once your workspace is open, add a new java project, give it a name,
such as A0, A1, etc. The defaults for the project when you click next are
probably fine, e.g., default JRE, separate folders for source and class
files. Once it is created, you will see a src folder for the source
files and bin for the class files.  Note that you may eventually create
additional folders for data.</p>

      <p>
Lastly a few tips on using eclipse to help you browse provided code. If
you let your mouse hover over an identifier, variable or method, a
window will pop up telling you what it is, and providing you with the
javadoc. If you hold ctrl and click on an identifier, it will take you
to its definition (e.g., the implementation of a method). This is a
great way to explore code rapidly! Note the yellow forward and back
buttons on the tool bar are useful for going back to where you were
after control clicking an identifier.</p>


      <p><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;"><em>Provided
Code</em></span></p>

      <p>Download the <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F13/asetup/a0.zip">provided
code</a>
and dump it into a new java project. Note that the code lives in the <i>comp557.a0</i>
package. Please do not
change the package name for any of your assignments. This
example code contains a minimal example framework with which you can
try out the OpenGL API, and may be of use during the
tutorials.</p>

      <p>You'll want to put the provided code (see below) in src
folder of your
new project, and there are lots of ways to do this. Most
importantly, you need the directory structure to match the
package structure! An easy way is to copy the directory provided in the
zip file and paste it into the src directory. Since everything lives in
the package <span style="font-style: italic;">comp557</span>
you need this folder (i.e., you can't just copy and
paste the <span style="font-style: italic;">a0 </span>folder
into src). If you copy files into your project on
the file system side, you'll need to tell Eclipse to refresh its view
of the project (right click on the project and select refresh). This
summarizes the steps for "dumping the source code into a project".
You'll have lots of errors at this point, but they all go away when you
attach the jars as specified in the assignment.</p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;"><em>Libraries</em></span></p>

      <p>The provided code uses <i>JOGL</i> for
OpenGL
bindings.
      <i>JOGL</i> has been around for many years and has
changed over the years to keep up to date with the evolving OpenGL
specification.  The latest version involves "profiles" to
allow for applications to be developed for different versions of OpenGL
and different hardware (e.g., OpenGL ES 2.0, as you would use for an
Android or iOS device). Grab the latest release version from
<a href="http://jogamp.org/">jogamp.org</a>.  In version 2.0 of JOGL,
installation has become slightly simpler with respect to the native
libraries.
See <a href="https://jogamp.org/jogl/doc/userguide/#localinstallation"> 
local installation information</a>, and download the 7zip file.
<!--, for instance,
version <a href="https://jogamp.org/deployment/archive/rc/v2.0.2/">2.0.2</a>.
Be sure to download the appropriate version for your platform.-->
Unzip the archive somewhere convenient. You will want to include
jogl-all.jar and gluegen-rt.jar in your build path, and likewise
attach the provided source code for your own convenience (e.g.,
jogl-src.zip).  Because you will need to do this for each assignment,
you will want to set this up as a user library.

<!-- <p>To complete most assignments you will likely need to use
additional jars, such as the <i>vecmath</i> jar for working with
matrices, points, and vectors. The <i>vecmath</i> package is available
as part of JAVA3D, but instead of installing the full Java3D, you will
be provided with the jar files on an assignment by assignment basis.
For vecmath, you can attach the jar itself as source as the source
code will be included.</p>  -->

<p>You will be using several jars in each assignment, and to save time
in setting up dependancies it will be useful to create a user defined
library that groups together the necessary jars.  Create a user
library called JOGL2 and add to it jogl.all.jar and jlugen-rt.jar.
You will want to set the source code attachment and native library
location.  As we will also be regularly using vecmath.jar and
mintools.jar you can add these too once they are provided. </p>

<a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F13/asetup/userlib.png"><img width="562" src="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/comp557F13/asetup/userlib.png"></a>

<p>Right click on your project, select settings, and choose Java Build
  Path, and click on the Libraries tab.  When you click Add Library,
  select User Library and click next, choose User Libraries, and click
  New. Give it the name JOGL2.  Now add the jars to your library, set
  the source path, and if necessary native library paths. Once
  finished, you can select the user library you created for inclusion.


      <p><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;"><em>JOGL2.0 Idiosyncrasies</em></span></p>


<p>As mentioned previously, different profiles are available, e.g.,
  GL2, GL3.  You will notice in the provided code that we are pretty
  much exclusively using GL2.</p>

<p>OpenGL functions that have parameters that take pointers or arrays
as argiments in C are mapped to Java an a way that facilitates code
porting, but may look mysterious at first.  For instance, a glVertex
  call that accepts an array of doubles, in JOGL, has the method 
signature glVertex3dv(double[] v, int v_offset).  We typically provide
  0 for the offset.  Alternatively we can use native IO buffers.</p>

<p> DebugGL is your friend!  It will call glGetError for you and throw
  exceptions.  Notice how the provided code sets the GL2 to be a
  DebugGL2. </p>
