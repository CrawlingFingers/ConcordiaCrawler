</p><p></p><h3>Description</h3>  
<p>
A course for students with no previous knowledge of computer science. The course is intended to provide a survey of selected topics in computer science starting from how computers store data (text, numbers, image, sound, and video), to the inner workings of computers (hardware) and moving on to more advanced topics such as computability, complexity, web design, AI, robotics, cryptography, and social implications of computing. (3 credits; 3 hours per week)
<p>
We will also explore concrete questions such as: What are the origins of computation? 
Are there things that computers cannot do? 
How do we build internet search engines? 
How do you teach a robot to walk and talk? 
How can we safely communicate confidential information? 
How can computers help treat individuals with chronic illnesses?<br>
<p>
