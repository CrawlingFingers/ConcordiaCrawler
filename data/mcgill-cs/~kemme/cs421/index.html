</h2><h2><a name="Outline"></a>Outline</h2>With the raise of e-commerce all
of us use complex information systems on a daily basis -- by accessing
the Minerva university system, by banking online, by buying a book
online.&nbsp;Database management systems (DBMS) build the backbone
software systems that store all mission-critical data of these
information systems. The big DBMS vendors like Oracle, IBM (DB2) or
Microsoft (SQL Server) are
well known players on the IT market; Linux distributions (for instance
Red Hat), include an
open source database management system in their distribution package;
even the Microsoft Office suite contains kind of a database
management system. And recently, the NoSQL movement has shown that
data management has become important in many new domains and markets.
As a result, knowing at least the basic concepts
behind
these systems and how to use them is becoming an essential skill for
IT specialists.
<p>This course is intended to give students a solid background in
relational DBMS. Furthermore is outlines non-relational solutions. If you are interested
in becoming an effective user of a DBMS, or a DBMS professional, this
is a good introduction to the topic. The course has two main parts:
the first part explains <b> how to use </b> a DBMS, the second part
looks
at <b> how the DBMS works internally </b>.
</p>
<p>The first part will discuss the <b> design of databases </b> and
how to write <b> queries </b> that extract the data you are looking for. Or in other words: how can you squeeze your "real world"
data (the product information
of a bookstore, the student and activity information of a students'
association) into the relational data model of the database system and
how can you retrieve the data later. </p>
<p>The second part of the course is system-oriented and discusses the
internals of a DBMS. Using a DBMS is one issue, using it efficiently
and correctly is a different story. DBMS are designed to work for very
different application areas and present a general purpose software. In
order to be able to tune a DBMS to your specific requirements you must
know how your database application is executed by the DBMS. <br>
This
second part will cover two main areas: <b> Transaction management </b> is
important to keep data consistent when updates occur. <b> Query
execution </b>
is the process that efficiently finds the small set of data the user
wants to see out of a possibly huge database.

</p>
<p>At the end of the course we will talk about non-relational (NoSQL)
data models and their: semi-structured data that is better able to handle
document-type data and key-value stores that are better able to store
and query huge amount of data in a distributed fashion. 
</p>
<p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Objectives:</span></p><p>In this
course you will</p>
<ul>
  <li>learn the fundamental steps needed to develop a database
  application using a commercial DBMS</li>
  <li>apply this knowledge to build a database application for a
  specific application domain</li>
  <li>acquire the skills to quickly learn and understand new data
  models and DBMS interfaces</li>
  <li>understand some of the internals of a relational DBMS, and with
  that,&nbsp;</li>
  <ul><li>get to know the structure and complexity of a large software
    system</li>
    
<li>see how knowing about the internals of the DBMS can help you
improve your usage of a DBMS as an application programmer</li></ul>
<li>get an understanding of performance in a DBMS</li>


<li>conduct a relatively large scale project in a
team</li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>

<p><b><br>Detailed Topic List </b> (each topic between 2 and 4 lectures):
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Introduction
  </li>
  <li> Entity-Relationship Model
  </li>
  <li> Relational Model and Data Definition Language
  </li>
  <li> Relational Algebra
  </li>
  <li> Functional Dependencies
  </li>
  <li> SQL I: Simple Queries
  </li>
  <li> SQL II: Advanced Queries
  </li>
  <li> SQL III: Constraints and Triggers
  </li>
  <li> SQL V: Application Programming
    </li>
      <li> Transactions
  </li>
  <li> Concurrency Control
  </li>
  <li> Essentials of File and Disk Management
  </li>
  <li> Recovery
  </li>
  <li> Indexing
  </li>
  <li> Query Execution
  </li>
    <li> Semi-structured data (XML, JSon)
  </li>
    <li> Key-value stores and map-reduce
  </li>
  <li> Review
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Prerequisites: </b>COMP-206, COMP-251 and COMP-302: Knowledge of
data structures, algorithms, programming languages and basics of
program development. Knowledge in operating systems is of advantage.
</p>
<p><b>Marking Scheme: </b>There are 4 written assignments, three
project deliveries, one midterm, and
one
final. The scheme will be<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>16% assignments (4% for each assignment)</li>
  <li>15% project deliveries (5% for each deliverable)</li>
  <li>10% midterm</li>
  <li>59% final</li>
</ul>

<p>In assignments the students have to solve concrete
problems. In some cases, late turn-in
might not be possible (e.g., if I want to post the solution before the
midterm/final). Otherwise, a late turn-in will result in
a penalty of 10% per day (e.g. if an assignment has in total 100
points,
a student achieves 80 points but turns in the assignment a day too
late,
then he/she will receive 80-10=70 points. <br>
<br> The assignments count 4% each.
<br> The last assignment might be done in groups of several
students. This still has to be determined.
</p>
<p>The three programming deliveries build a project in which
  students have to develope and build
database
application for a real-world domain. The students will design a schema,
create a database using DB2, maintain, query and update the data,
and develop a
application programs. 


The students
will
work in teams of three on the programming project. All team members are
supposed to work together and participate equally in the project
development.
